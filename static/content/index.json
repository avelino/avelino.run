    "content" : "In recent years, AI tools based on LLMs (large language models) have become widely available to assist with programming. Platforms like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT promise to autocomplete code, suggest solutions, and boost developer productivity. Even with all this potential, many developers show resistance or hesitation when it comes to adopting these tools in their daily work.\n\nThis blog post explores why that happens, bringing together recent data on AI adoption and psychological aspects that help explain this reluctance. We'll also discuss how AI can be a powerful ally for developers – as long as it's used with discernment and a solid understanding of the business context (which only humans actually have).\n\nThe Rise of AI Coding Tools\n\nThe adoption of AI coding assistants has grown rapidly. According to a Google DORA report (2025), 90% of technology professionals already use AI in their workflows, a jump of 14% compared to the previous year (source: observer.com). These assistants are used for tasks ranging from writing code snippets to executing tests and performing security reviews (observer.com). Leading companies are investing heavily in this space – and in fact, 85% of developers say AI has made them more productive, although 41% say the improvement was only slight (observer.com).\n\nDespite the initial optimism, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. Trust in AI tools has not grown at the same pace as adoption. Only 24% of developers say they trust AI-generated code a lot, while almost a third admit they trust it very little or not at all (observer.com). Other surveys confirm this caution: more developers distrust AI accuracy (46%) than trust it (33%), and only a small fraction (~3%) report full confidence in the assistant's responses (survey.stackoverflow.co).\n\nIn other words, AI has entered the workflow, but with one foot out the door. Many developers see it as an assistant, not a partner, as a Google Cloud research lead put it (observer.com). This paradox – high availability of AI versus low trust – sets the stage for understanding where the resistance comes from.\n\nResistance to Change Is Real\n\nIt's no surprise there's hesitation. Resisting change in the workplace is a very common human reaction, especially when it involves disruptive innovation. With the new wave of AI tools, this shows up as lower-than-expected adoption and shy usage of more advanced features.\n\nFor example, a large study with 28,698 software engineers showed that only 41% used an AI coding assistant in the first year after it was introduced, even with organizational encouragement (papers.ssrn.com). In certain groups, adoption was even lower – only 31% of women engineers and 39% of developers over 40 used the tool at all (papers.ssrn.com). These numbers illustrate how strong the cultural and psychological barrier to adoption can be, even when the technology is already there.\n\nFrom an organizational standpoint, three out of four companies report that the hardest part of implementing AI is getting people to change how they work (bain.com). Under pressure or tight deadlines, many developers fall back to old habits instead of using the new tool (bain.com). This resistance doesn't mean stubbornness for no reason – there are usually legitimate concerns underneath it.\n\nNext, we'll look at the main psychological factors that make developers wary of relying on AI.\n\nWhy Are Developers Afraid? (Psychological Factors)\n\nFear of Losing Their Job or Relevance\n\nA latent concern is that AI might make developers obsolete. Almost half of professionals (49%) fear that automation will replace their role in the next five years (about.gitlab.com). This fear of substitution can drive resistance: some people avoid adopting the tool so they don't train their own replacement.\n\nOn top of that, some worry that using AI could undermine their importance on the team – after all, if anyone with AI can produce code, where does that leave the value of the human specialist? Research points exactly to this: some engineers are concerned that AI hurts their role within the team (bain.com). This sense of vulnerability in their job is a powerful reason to keep AI at arm's length.\n\nFear of Appearing Less Competent\n\nDevelopers tend to be proud of their ability to solve complex problems. Admitting they need help from an AI can sound, to some, like a sign of lack of competence.\n\nA recent academic study describes this as a competence penalty: in an experiment, engineers who used AI to help write code received competence ratings 9% lower (for the exact same output) compared to those who did not use AI – and women were penalized even more heavily (papers.ssrn.com).\n\nIn other words, there is a perception (and sometimes a reality) that those who rely on AI are seen as less capable. Many developers anticipate this stigma and therefore avoid using the tool to protect their professional reputation (papers.ssrn.com). Put simply, ego and identity are on the line: If I don't write every line myself, am I less of a developer? That mindset can drag adoption down, especially in cultures that glorify the lone hero who codes everything by hand.\n\nDistrust in the Accuracy and Quality of AI-Generated Code\n\nProgrammers are naturally skeptical – finding errors and bugs is literally part of the job. With AI, it's no different. There is a trust deficit when it comes to AI-generated answers.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the majority do not fully trust AI-suggested code (only ~3% trust it blindly) (survey.stackoverflow.co). More experienced developers are the most cautious group, with the highest rate of no trust at all (20%) among experience levels (survey.stackoverflow.co).\n\nThis caution is justified: AI models often provide solutions that are almost correct, but not quite, which can introduce subtle errors and require extra debugging later (arstechnica.com). Many developers report frustration when AI hallucinates incorrect code or provides context-free suggestions – for example, a generic solution that simply doesn't apply to the specific case at hand.\n\nEach failure reduces trust and reinforces the idea that it's safer to rely on your own knowledge. If you're going to review every line of AI-generated code in detail, some developers prefer to write everything from scratch.\n\nAttachment to Control and Comfort Zone\n\nSoftware development is not just a technical activity – it's also a craft of authorship and control. Handing part of that control over to a machine can feel uncomfortable.\n\nMany developers are proud of understanding every line of code they write; with AI generating entire blocks, there is a real fear of becoming a passive operator. Unsurprisingly, most people see AI as just an assistant that suggests things, and hesitate to hand over the wheel completely (observer.com).\n\nThere's also the habit factor: years of experience shape personal workflows. Under pressure, professionals usually choose what they already know – even if the new tool might theoretically be better (bain.com). Learning to use AI effectively (writing good prompts, interpreting and debugging its output) takes time and a mindset shift. Without proper training, the novelty can feel more like an obstacle than a help. In fact, companies note that AI skill gaps (for example, knowing how to review AI-generated code) contribute to AI being used far below its potential (bain.com).\n\nIn short, changing habits is hard – and in everyday work, many people prefer to stick with familiar tools and methods, where they feel in control.\n\nAI as an Ally: Balancing Productivity and Caution\n\nDespite all the resistance, it's important to highlight that those who manage to integrate AI into their work see real, tangible benefits.\n\nStudies show 10–15% productivity gains in teams that adopt coding assistants, even when you factor in some amount of rework (bain.com). AI tools can automate repetitive tasks, suggest standardized solutions, and even help generate tests, freeing developers to focus on more creative or higher-level challenges. It's no coincidence that organizations that embrace AI strategically are shipping software faster and more reliably (observer.com).\n\nA leadership guideline from DX sums it up well:\n\n> Developers who leverage AI will outperform those who resist adoption.\n\n(getdx.com)\n\nIn other words, there is a real opportunity cost in ignoring these tools – in the long run, those who learn to use them well will be able to deliver more value.\n\nHowever, embracing AI doesn't mean doing it blindly. The key is to balance machine efficiency with human expertise.\n\nNo AI knows:\n\n- the domain of your business\n- the specific rules of your application\n- the exact needs of your users\n\nThe people who have that knowledge are developers and product teams.\n\nAs one researcher put it, AI is only as good as the data it has access to. If we don't provide proper context, it will give generic and potentially useless answers (observer.com).\n\nIt's up to the developer to provide the right instructions and, above all, critically validate the result before shipping anything. AI tools still make logical mistakes and do not truly understand business intent on their own – they should not be treated as infallible oracles, but as an incredibly fast (and sometimes clumsy) pair programmer.\n\nPractically speaking, this means:\n\n- reviewing each generated snippet\n- writing and running tests\n- adjusting details as needed\n\nThe best teams are integrating AI with good engineering practices: code reviews focused on checking whether the AI suggestion really does what it should, automated tests to catch regressions, and clear policies on where it's acceptable to rely on AI-generated code (for example, maybe fine for an internal script, but not for a critical module without human audit) (bain.com).\n\nConclusion: Conscious Adaptation\n\nThe arrival of AI in software development brings a mix of excitement and anxiety. We've seen that many developers resist it out of fear of losing space, protecting their reputation, or simply technical caution – and these concerns are valid.\n\nOn the other hand, completely ignoring AI can mean falling behind in productivity and professional growth. The ideal path lies in the middle ground: adopting these tools as allies, without giving up critical thinking.\n\nRemember: responsibility for the shipped code is still ours. As professionals, we need to understand and own what we deliver to users – and no AI is going to change that.\n\nInstead of seeing AI as a competitor, it's far more productive to view it as an extension of our capabilities. It helps us write code, but it cannot replace our understanding of the problem or our creativity in solving it. While AI takes care of the boilerplate, it's up to us to ensure the final product respects business rules, is secure, and is high quality.\n\nThose who learn to use these tools with discernment will get the best of both worlds: speed and quality. In short, AI can help us a lot – as long as we never give up understanding what we're delivering.\n\nAfter all, the ones who truly know the terrain (and see the bigger picture) are humans, not machines. With an adjusted mindset (less fear, more openness) and solid engineering practices, we can embrace innovation without losing control of the steering wheel.\n\nThe result is a developer who is more productive and more valuable – exactly because they know how to leverage new tools without compromising technical excellence.\n\nSources\n\n- Gai, Phyliss et al.

    "content" : "Building an audience around a static site is fundamentally different from social media. While platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn provide built-in notification systems, static sites are silent by default. Your readers discover your content only if they remember to check back—which they rarely do.\n\nThis is the core problem: how do you keep your community engaged when your publishing platform has no native notification system?\n\nThe answer isn't to abandon static sites for dynamic platforms. It's to add the missing notification layer through automation. In this article, I'll show you how to build a Substack-like newsletter system for Hugo sites using Resend.com and GitHub Actions—complete with duplicate prevention, automatic post detection, and community engagement mechanisms.\n\nThe static site engagement problem\n\nStatic site generators like Hugo excel at performance, simplicity, and hosting economics. They generate pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be served from CDNs for pennies. But this architectural strength creates an engagement weakness: there's no server-side logic to notify readers when new content is published.\n\nTraditional solutions have significant drawbacks:\n\n- RSS feeds: Require readers to actively use feed readers—most don't\n- Social media announcements: Fragment your audience across platforms and create dependency on external networks (see Interactions: IRL vs. Social Media - What Really Matters? for why direct channels matter)\n- Email newsletters: Manual effort creates friction; posts often go unannounced or get announced inconsistently\n\nThe gap between publishing and notifying leads to a classic problem: you write great content, but your audience never knows it exists. Engagement metrics stagnate, and the community you're trying to build remains dormant.\n\nThe automation solution: Hugo + Resend + GitHub Actions\n\nThe solution is to automate the entire notification flow:\n\n1. Detect new posts automatically when you commit to your repository\n2. Extract content metadata (title, description, URL) from markdown frontmatter\n3. Send broadcast emails via Resend's broadcast API to all subscribers\n4. Prevent duplicate sends by tracking what's already been delivered\n5. Update state automatically in version control for auditability\n\nThis creates a closed loop: write → commit → publish → notify. No manual steps, no forgotten announcements, no duplicate sends.\n\nWhy this architecture works\n\nGitHub Actions as the orchestrator: Actions trigger on git events, making them perfect for content published detection. The workflow runs in a sandboxed environment with access to your repository state, git history, and secrets. (For more on GitHub Actions workflows, see How to reuse workflow in GitHub Action pipeline.)\n\nResend for email delivery: Resend's broadcast API is designed for newsletters. Unlike transactional email APIs, broadcasts are optimized for one-to-many sends with built-in unsubscribe handling and delivery tracking.\n\nState management in git: Tracking sent posts in .newsletter_state.json keeps the system auditable and reproducible. Every change is versioned, making it easy to understand what was sent when.\n\nHugo frontmatter as the data source: Markdown frontmatter already contains title, description, and URL—everything needed to generate newsletter content without additional configuration.\n\nImplementation: building the system\n\nThe implementation consists of three components:\n\n1. GitHub Actions workflow\n\nThe workflow triggers on pushes to content/blog/ and executes the newsletter script:\n\n``yaml\nname: Newsletter on new post\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n    paths:\n      - content/blog/\n\njobs:\n  send-broadcast:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n        with:\n          fetch-depth: 2  Needed for git diff\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version: 20\n      - name: Install deps\n        run: npm ci || npm i\n      - name: Send newsletter broadcast\n        run: node .github/scripts/send_newsletter.mjs\n        env:\n          RESEND_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.RESEND_API_KEY }}\n          RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID: ${{ secrets.RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID }}\n          NEWSLETTER_FROM: ${{ secrets.NEWSLETTER_FROM }}\n          SITE_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.SITE_BASE_URL }}\n      - name: Commit newsletter state\n        run: |\n          git config user.name GitHub Actions\n          git config user.email actions@github.com\n          git add .newsletter_state.json\n          git commit -m update newsletter state [skip ci] || echo no changes\n          git push\n`\n\nSee the full implementation: .github/workflows/newsletter.yml\n\nKey design decisions:\n\n- fetch-depth: 2: Required to compare HEAD~1 and HEAD for detecting new files\n- Path-based triggering: Only runs when blog content changes, reducing unnecessary executions\n- Automatic state commit: Updates the tracking file and commits it back, creating an audit trail\n\n2. Newsletter script\n\nThe script handles detection, extraction, and sending:\n\n`javascript\nimport fs from 'fs';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { Resend } from 'resend';\nimport matter from 'gray-matter';\nimport { execSync } from 'child_process';\n\n// Detect new files via git diff\nconst diff = execSync('git diff --name-status HEAD~1 HEAD').toString();\nconst added = diff\n  .split('\\n')\n  .map(l => l.trim().split('\\t'))\n  .filter(p => p[0] === 'A' && p[1] && p[1].startsWith('content/blog/'))\n  .map(p => p[1])\n  .filter(f => /\\.(md|mdx)$/.test(f));\n\n// Read state to prevent duplicates\nconst statePath = path.join(process.cwd(), '.newsletter_state.json');\nlet state = { lastSent: [] };\nif (fs.existsSync(statePath)) {\n  state = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(statePath, 'utf8'));\n}\n\n// Process each new post\nfor (const postPath of added) {\n  const fileId = postPath.replace(/^content\\/blog\\//, '');\n\n  if (state.lastSent.includes(fileId)) {\n    continue; // Skip already sent posts\n  }\n\n  // Extract frontmatter and content\n  const raw = fs.readFileSync(postPath, 'utf8');\n  const { data, content } = matter(raw);\n\n  // Generate email HTML\n  const html = generateEmailHTML(data, content);\n\n  // Send broadcast\n  const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);\n  await resend.broadcasts.create({\n    audienceId: process.env.RESEND_AUDIENCE_ID,\n    from: process.env.NEWSLETTER_FROM,\n    subject: Novo post: ${data.title},\n    html,\n  });\n\n  // Update state\n  state.lastSent.push(fileId);\n  fs.writeFileSync(statePath, JSON.stringify(state, null, 2));\n}\n`\n\nSee the full implementation: .github/scripts/send_newsletter.mjs\n\nThe script's logic:\n\n- Git-based detection: Uses git diff to find files added in the latest commit—more reliable than file timestamps\n- Frontmatter parsing: Uses gray-matter to extract Hugo frontmatter, including custom URL fields\n- Duplicate prevention: Checks .newsletter_state.json before sending, ensuring posts are only sent once\n- Broadcast API: Uses Resend's broadcast endpoint, which is optimized for newsletter delivery\n\n3. State management\n\nThe .newsletter_state.json file tracks all sent posts:\n\n`json\n{\n  lastSent: [\n    blog/2025-11-automating-newsletter-hugo-resend-github-actions.md,\n    blog/2025-10-open-source-governance-reference-leading-engineering-teams.md\n  ]\n}\n`\n\nSee the current state file: .newsletter_state.json\n\nThis file is:\n\n- Versioned in git: Full history of what was sent when\n- Human-readable: Easy to inspect and debug\n- Immutable: Posts are never removed from the list, preventing re-sends even if the file is reset\n\nCommunity engagement mechanisms\n\nThe automation doesn't just solve the technical problem—it creates engagement patterns. This aligns with broader principles of community building in open source, where consistent, automated communication channels reduce friction and enable scalable engagement:\n\n1. Consistent delivery timing\n\nReaders learn when to expect your content. Automation ensures every post is announced, building trust through reliability.\n\n2. Zero-friction publishing\n\nNo manual steps means you're more likely to publish consistently. The system removes the I should announce this on email mental overhead.\n\n3. Direct relationship with readers\n\nEmail newsletters create a direct channel that you own. Unlike social media platforms, there's no algorithm deciding who sees your content. This direct communication is the most efficient way to scale your outreach, as text-based communication allows for asynchronous, thoughtful engagement.\n\n4. Analytics and feedback\n\nResend provides delivery analytics: open rates, click rates, and subscriber growth. This data helps you understand what resonates with your audience.\n\n5. Unsubscribe handling\n\nResend automatically handles unsubscribe requests and maintains compliance with email regulations (GDPR, CAN-SPAM). The system respects user preferences without manual intervention.\n\nTechnical considerations and edge cases\n\nHandling multiple posts in one commit\n\nThe script processes all new posts in a commit sequentially. If you publish multiple posts at once, each gets its own broadcast email—readers see all new content, not just the latest.\n\nURL generation from Hugo permalinks\n\nHugo's permalink configuration can generate URLs that don't match the file path. The script handles this by:\n\n1. Checking frontmatter url field first (Hugo's explicit URL)\n2. Falling back to slug if present\n3. Defaulting to filename-based slug if neither exists\n\nThis ensures newsletter links always point to the correct published URL.\n\nInitial state population\n\nWhen setting up the system, populate .newsletter_state.json with existing posts to prevent re-sending:\n\n`bash\nfind content/blog -name *.md | sed 's|^content/||' | jq -R -s 'split(\\n) | map(select(length > 0))' > .newsletter_state.json\n`\n\nError handling\n\nThe script exits on error, causing the GitHub Action to fail. This surfaces issues immediately:\n\n- Missing environment variables\n- Resend API errors\n- File system errors\n\nAction logs show exactly what went wrong, making debugging straightforward.\n\nComparison with alternatives\n\n| Approach | Pros | Cons |\n|----------|------|------|\n| Manual email | Full control, personal touch | Time-consuming, easy to forget |\n| RSS to email services | No code required | Limited customization, service dependency |\n| WordPress plugins | Easy setup | Requires WordPress, plugin maintenance |\n| This solution | Automated, version-controlled, scalable | Requires GitHub, initial setup |\n\nThe automated approach scales: whether you publish once a month or daily, the system handles it without additional effort.\n\nConclusion: automation as community infrastructure\n\nBuilding an active community around static content requires making your publishing system push rather than pull. Automation transforms static sites from silent archives into active communication channels.\n\nThe Hugo + Resend + GitHub Actions combination provides:\n\n- Zero-maintenance operation: Write and commit—the system handles the rest\n- Duplicate prevention: State management ensures posts are never sent twice\n- Audit trail: Git history shows exactly what was sent when\n- Scalability: Handles one post or hundreds without additional configuration\n- Direct ownership: You own the subscriber list, email templates, and delivery mechanism\n\nMost importantly, this system turns consistency into a default behavior rather than a conscious effort. When publishing becomes as simple as git commit && git push`, you're more likely to maintain the publishing cadence that keeps communities engaged.\n\nThe technical details matter, but the real value is in creating infrastructure that supports long-term community building. Automation removes friction, and removing friction enables consistency. Consistency is what builds engaged communities.\n\n---\n\n\nImplementation resources\n\n- Full implementation: avelino/avelino.run repository\n  - GitHub Actions workflow\n  - Newsletter script\n  - Email template\n  - State file\n- Resend Broadcast API Documentation\n- GitHub Actions Documentation\n- Hugo Content Management\n- gray-matter Package",

    "content" : "Talking about motivation might seem simple to those who have never led a large team. From my perspective, running the day-to-day technology of a Brazilian startup with over 260 people, it’s impossible to ignore how motivation is diverse, fluid, and deeply personal.\n\nMotivation on the technology floor\n\nNothing is more valuable than recognizing the real context of each team member. This is not just LinkedIn talk. Here at Buser, working with multidisciplinary teams makes it clear: what drives a backend engineer doesn’t necessarily inspire a frontend engineer; a product manager seeks a sense of belonging, while an SRE developer is motivated by radical autonomy.\n\n📖 Peopleware sums up the essence of this challenge:\n> “The biggest mistake managers make is to assume that everyone is motivated by the same things that motivate themselves.”\n> — Peopleware, Tom DeMarco & Timothy Lister\n\nRecognizing that each person is searching for something different is a basic requirement for anyone leading technology at scale—ignore this, and you’re aiming only for mediocre results.\n\nLeadership experience: how I personalize motivation\n\nWhen I became CTO, I thought technical skills were everything. I quickly realized culture, rituals, and listening weighed even more. The real work is in understanding nuances:\n\n- Implementing 1:1 sessions to listen to personal ambitions https://avelino.run/quote/lifestyle/foco-em-evoluir-e-auto-conhecimento/;\n- Setting flexible goals so no one feels boxed in;\n- Encouraging challenges in areas that bring fulfillment, not just operational results.\n\nIn my daily routine, the feedback that brought the most development almost never came from formal meetings—but from honest conversations, over coffee, while cycling, or during retrospectives where the team risks showing vulnerability.\n\nDiscipline’s role when motivation swings\n\nMotivation is necessary, but not sufficient. I had to adapt and learn that discipline is what sustains the journey https://avelino.run/quote/lifestyle/transformando-dores-musculares-em-amor/. Not every day is the best day to innovate, implement, or debug. From sports—and I bring this to management—I learned that routine and consistency amplify results.\nEarly in my career, I sought motivation in the adrenaline of delivering features. Over time, I realized the true value is creating an environment where people grow regardless of the “motivation peak” of the moment.\n\n> “Projects fail not for lack of techniques, but for ignoring human factors. Motivated and respected teams avoid waste and deliver better solutions.”\n> — Peopleware, Tom DeMarco & Timothy Lister\n\nCustomizing culture and goals: real startup cases\n\nBuser’s engineering culture evolved to embrace multiple motivational styles. A few practices that have proven effective:\n\n- I allow engineers to propose their own challenges, rather than only accepting top-down goals;\n- Celebrating both small and big wins, creating moments of authentic recognition;\n- Giving frank feedback, including the need to reinvent processes when we notice collective demotivation.\n\nNone of this works unless the leader is willing to be vulnerable, correct course, and make room for others’ vulnerability.

Recent studies reinforce this effect as a buffer against burnout (PMC 2024), and there is already work linking psychological safety to the software engineering environment (arXiv 2025).\n\n- Hackman and team effectiveness: Richard Hackman proposed that high-performing teams depend on five conditions: clear purpose, well-defined boundaries, consistent norms and roles, organizational support, and competent coaching (Hackman – What Makes for a Great Team).\n\nThese findings already show that rigid environments, based on fear or hierarchy alone, destroy performance. This is where open source logic comes in as a viable alternative.\n\nOpen source governance: mechanisms that work\n\nOSS governance survives at global scale because it created institutional coordination mechanisms:\n\n- Radical transparency: issues, PRs, and decisions are public. As Peshawaria says:\n  > “In a transparent world, secrecy is the enemy of trust. Leadership today is about being open, even when it is uncomfortable.”\n  This visibility accelerates learning and collective trust.\n\n- Technical meritocracy (broadened):\n  > “Open source leadership is about democratizing power, but not equalizing it. Influence flows to those who add the most value.”\n  Studies show that leadership in OSS emerges not only from technical contribution but also from communication skills and community influence (arXiv – Follow the Leader, 2022). In other words, technical merit matters, but reputation and social capital coexist.\n\n- Autonomy with accountability: the fork symbolizes maximum freedom but carries the cost of maintenance. This mechanism regulates autonomy. In companies, the parallel is to allow squads to explore alternatives, as long as they own outcome and integration metrics.\n\nThese mechanisms echo Hackman’s conditions: purpose, norms, boundaries, and support. OSS applies them in a radical way; corporations can use them as an adapted reference.\n\nHow I think: a CTO and maintainer’s critical reading\n\nMy experience connects both worlds: OSS and corporate management.\n\n- Documented decisions: in communities, PRs function as a public court. At Buser and in OSS projects, adopting open RFCs helped me create legitimacy and institutional memory.\n- Fluid leadership: in OSS, leadership is emergent and temporary. In corporate settings, adopting this flow — specialists taking on roles according to context — works better than fixing authority. Peshawaria sums it up:\n  > “The open source world thrives because leadership is temporary, emergent, and conditional upon contribution.”\n- Burnout and centralization: both in OSS and in corporations, when a few people concentrate critical responsibilities, the result is exhaustion. The path is always to distribute leadership.\n\nOSS is a mirror: it shows that teams can function without rigid hierarchy, as long as they have purpose, transparency mechanisms, and healthy meritocracy.\n\nConclusion\n\nOpen source is not romanticism; it is the largest social laboratory of technology governance in history. If volunteer communities created systems that sustain the internet, there is no excuse for corporate teams to remain stuck in the 1920 model.\n\nThe central lesson is clear: engineering leadership is not HR resource control, but building systems where autonomy, purpose, and accountability can flourish.\n\nThis is the reference. The rest is an illusion of control.\n\n---\n\nExternal references cited\n\n- Edmondson, A. (1999). Psychological Safety and Learning Behavior in Work Teams\n- Ma, J. et al. (2024).

    "content" : "TL;DR: _Vulnerabilities test trust. Fast fixes, clear communication, and disciplined process turn crises into credibility._\n\n> This weekend, my open-source project prestd was hit with its second CVE-like advisory (GHSA-p46v-f2x8-qp98). We rallied the community and shipped a fix within hours. Intense—and gratifying: proof that crises can teach trust.\n\n\n\nThat rollercoaster is a reminder: some projects sprint, others stall. To see why, let’s connect a fresh incident to infamous CVEs, grounded practice, and a few enduring ideas.\n\nWhat a CVE Really Signals\n\nA CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) entry isn’t just a line in MITRE’s database. It’s a public test of how a project earns and maintains trust. As Bruce Schneier wrote in _Secrets and Lies_, “security is a process, not a product.” A CVE spotlights where the process broke—and where it can be strengthened.\n\nEric Raymond’s _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_ argues that “given enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.” The reality: those eyes need discipline, incentives, and time. Without them, the shallow becomes deep.\n\nTrust here is multi-dimensional. It is technical, social, and temporal: it rests on code quality, test coverage, reproducible builds, and safe defaults; on norms of disclosure, maintainer responsiveness, and independent review; and on how quickly an issue travels from report to triage, fix, release, and finally adoption.\n\nMost postmortems reveal that it’s rarely a single failure. It’s a chain: a sharp edge in API design, a missing test, an inattentive review, an overburdened maintainer, a release delayed by packaging friction, and then slow adoption downstream. CVEs make that chain visible.\n\nWhen Time Was the Differentiator\n\nHeartbleed (OpenSSL, 2014 – CVE-2014-0160) — the patch landed quickly, but ecosystem patching took months. Fixing code is the easy part; getting updates deployed is the real work. (NVD link)\n\nLog4Shell (Log4j, 2021 – CVE-2021-44228) — fixes were prepared under embargo, but the package’s ubiquity demanded weeks of stabilization. A classic tragedy-of-the-commons case. (NVD link)\n\nJASBUG (Microsoft, 2015 – CVE-2015-0008) — a design flaw that persisted for more than a year; sometimes architecture, not effort, is the bottleneck. (NVD link)\n\nXZ Utils Backdoor (2024 – CVE-2024-3094) — malicious code slipped into the supply chain; rollback was the fix, and collective vigilance made the difference. (NVD link)\n\nprestd (this case) — advisory published, fix shipped quickly, transparency preserved. No CVE (yet), but already a sign of maturity. (GHSA advisory)\n\nThe Race Against Delay\n\nWell-run projects often ship fixes in days, but public databases and ecosystem updates can lag by weeks. That gap—between “fixed” and “deployed”—is where attackers thrive. Time is typically lost in report quality (incomplete details drive back-and-forth), reproduction (flaky environments and missing fixtures), patch and review (risky fixes need independent eyes and backports), release engineering (packaging, signing, changelogs, and pipelines), and finally adoption (downstreams must notice, prioritize, test, and deploy). The lesson isn’t “no bugs,” it’s “minimize delay.”\n\nA useful lens is queueing theory: when triage and release run “hot” (utilization near 100%), wait times explode. Security benefits from deliberate slack—reserved capacity for surprises.\n\nWhy Some Projects Respond Faster\n\nTeams respond faster when ownership is clear (named security team, on-call, escalation paths), playbooks are pre-approved (conduct under embargo, scoping, who to involve), releases are boring and automated (tags, signatures, reproducibility), observability is real (time-to-triage, time-to-fix, time-to-adopt), and the culture privileges blameless learning. If you can’t measure cycle times by stage, the next incident will measure them for you—publicly.\n\nCoordinated Vulnerability Disclosure, Practically\n\nCoordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) balances user safety and transparency when there’s a trusted intake channel (SECURITY.md, security@, portal) with responder rotation. A healthy flow acknowledges the report within 24–72 hours, requests a POC, and agrees on an embargo; reproduces the issue in a controlled environment, assigns severity, and maps affected versions; develops the fix on a private branch with least-privilege review; prepares the advisory (CVE or GHSA), release notes, and upgrade guidance; coordinates publication timing, signs and distributes artifacts, notifies registries and distros; and, after release, publishes the postmortem, credits the reporter, and outlines hardening steps.\n\nA typical timeline might be: Day 0, receipt and acknowledgment with a triage owner; Days 1–2, reproduction confirmed, severity and scope defined, embargo agreed; Days 2–4, fix implemented with tests, backports prepared, advisory drafted; Day 5, coordinated publication, release cut, downstreams notified; Days 5–10, monitoring, hotfixes if needed, and postmortem published.\n\nSeverity Is Not the Whole Story\n\nCVSS helps, but it isn’t sufficient. Environmental and temporal factors dominate real risk: exploitability depends on configuration, exposure, and available mitigations; impact varies with data sensitivity, privilege boundaries, and blast radius; and patch risk matters—a theoretically “low” severity can be urgent if the fix is trivial and consumption massive. Use CVSS as input, not the decision function.\n\nSupply Chain Security, Pragmatically\n\nIn the supply chain, defense in depth means using SLSA as a maturity guide to guarantee provenance and verifiable builds; signing artifacts with Sigstore (cosign) and enforcing verification in CI/CD; publishing useful SBOMs accompanied by VEX to explain unaffected cases and cut noise; betting on reproducible builds by pinning compilers and base images; and “vendor less, review more”—remove gratuitous dependencies and prefer well-maintained libraries.\n\nA Maintainer’s Playbook (Practical and Repeatable)\n\nThe maintainer’s playbook is simple and repeatable: acknowledge and triage (confirm receipt, assess severity, identify affected versions and configurations), secure the channel (move to a private, trusted medium, respect reasonable embargoes), reproduce and test (MRE and a failing test before the fix), patch with independent review prioritizing least-risk, prepare releases (backports when needed, changelog, notes, and upgrade guide), coordinate disclosure (request a CVE or publish a GHSA with CWE, severity, and credits), notify downstreams (signed releases, registries, distros, and integrators), and close with postmortem and hardening (document root cause, remove footguns, automate guardrails). Two tactical additions change outcomes: keep a private “security staging” branch with CI ready for hotfixes, and maintain a pre-approved backport matrix to eliminate debate during incidents.\n\nHabits That Pay Off Before the Next CVE\n\nThere are habits that compound before the next incident: reduce fragile dependencies by preferring simple, audited components; automate scanning (SAST/DAST, secrets, dependency and container scans in CI); invest in tests and fuzzing where risk is concentrated; publish SECURITY.md and security.txt to create clear reporting paths; ship SBOMs and sign releases to raise traceability and upgrade confidence; and practice least privilege by default with narrow scopes, time-bound tokens, and safe defaults.\n\nGovernance and Funding Realities in OSS Security\n\nOpen source security often fails on incentives, not technique. Maintainers are volunteers or underfunded, and incident response competes with life; corporate consumers frequently externalize risk and internalize benefit, delaying updates for “business reasons”; and funding models rarely tie revenue to security outcomes—reputation does not scale alone. What works in practice includes maintenance-focused sponsorships, paid LTS, funded security audits, and vendor policies that reward prompt updates.\n\nBooks That Ground the Mindset\n\nAlguns livros ajudam a calibrar a mentalidade: _Secrets and Lies_ (Bruce Schneier) lembra que confiança é processo; _The Cathedral & the Bazaar_ (Eric S. Raymond) mostra o poder da transparência com disciplina; _Security Engineering_ (Ross Anderson) expõe o caráter técnico, social, político e econômico da segurança; _The Phoenix Project_ (Gene Kim) ilustra como falhas viram aprendizado; e _Antifragile_ (Nassim Nicholas Taleb) argumenta que sistemas podem ganhar com o estresse quando bem desenhados.\n\nWhat This Episode Teaches\n\nYour prestd incident isn’t a global meltdown like Heartbleed. It’s a clear, useful signal: fast fixes, transparent communication, and timely updates build trust. That’s the work. The deeper lesson: cultivate structures—governance, automation, and incentives—that make the “fast, transparent, adoptable” path the default.\n\nEvery CVE (or GHSA) is both a scar and a badge. Open source isn’t just code; it’s shared infrastructure that deserves guardrails more than heroics.\n\nIn Closing\n\nHandling a CVE isn’t about erasing risk. It’s about turning risk into credibility. Ship the fix fast, communicate honestly, and help the ecosystem update. That’s how vulnerabilities become learning curves—not landmines.\n\n---\n\nAppendix: Practical Templates\n\nAdvisory (GHSA/CVE) Skeleton\n\n- Affected package and versions\n- Summary and impact (what an attacker can do)\n- Vulnerable configurations and preconditions\n- Severity (CVSS base, temporal/environmental notes)\n- Proof of concept (optional or delayed)\n- Mitigations and workarounds (if any)\n- Fixed versions and upgrade guidance\n- Credits and acknowledgments\n- Timeline (received, confirmed, fixed, released)\n\nRelease Notes Skeleton (Security Release)\n\n- Summary of fixes with issue/advisory links\n- Upgrade notes (breaking changes, deprecations)\n- Backport coverage by branch\n- Verification steps (hashes, signatures)\n\nCoordinated Disclosure Email (Reporter → Maintainer)\n\n- Clear subject: Security issue in [project-name] [version]\n- Steps to reproduce and minimal POC\n- Impact description and likely severity\n- Affected versions and configurations\n- Suggested embargo window and availability for coordination\n\nPostmortem Outline\n\n- What happened (narrative timeline)\n- Technical root cause and contributing factors\n- Detection and response timeline metrics\n- What went well / what didn’t\n- Concrete preventive actions with owners and dates",

    "content" : "In software engineering, there's an inconvenient truth every experienced developer knows: the difference between a project that accelerates over time and one that grinds to a halt lies not in the brilliance of its initial code, but in its ability to evolve.\n\nLet's be honest. We've all felt that chill down our spine when tasked with modifying a critical module. That fear that a small change could trigger a cascade of unpredictable side effects. This feeling is a symptom. The diagnosis? A hostile codebase.\n\nA hostile codebase is expensive. It drains productivity, frustrates developers, and turns innovation into a risk management exercise. The goal of this article is to dive deep into the principles and practices that transform a software liability into a strategic asset: a healthy, friendly, and evolvable codebase.\n\nThe Why: Architecture as an Enabler of Agility\n\nThe agility to implement, test, and change behaviors doesn't happen by chance. It is a direct consequence of deliberate architectural decisions. The ultimate goal of a good architecture is to minimize the cost of change over the software's lifecycle.\n\nThe Dependency Rule and Clean Architecture\n\nRobert C. Martin, in his seminal book Clean Architecture, provides us with the most powerful guideline: The Dependency Rule.\n\n> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Source code dependencies should always point inwards, towards higher-level policies.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that your business logic (the rules that generate value for the company) should know nothing about the database you use, the web framework you've chosen, or the user interface you render.\n\n\n(Source: The Clean Coder Blog)\n\nWhy is this so transformative?\n1. Inherent Testability: If your business logic doesn't depend on a real database or web server, you can test it in milliseconds, using test doubles (mocks/stubs) in place of dependencies. Testing fast is the foundation for changing fast.\n2. Interchangeability: Imagine this scenario: the marketing team requests a new feature to log customer anniversary events, which can have varied data structures. To implement this efficiently, the engineering team concludes that the best approach is to migrate the profile storage to PostgreSQL to leverage the powerful jsonb data type.\n     In a coupled architecture, this would be a nightmare. The business logic would be entangled with calls to the old database, requiring a dangerous, high-risk rewrite across multiple parts of the system.\n     In a clean architecture, the business logic (the heart of the system) doesn't know which database is used. It only communicates with an abstraction, an interface like IProfileRepository. Implementing this new feature becomes a surgical task: we create a new PostgresProfileRepository class that implements the existing interface and plug it into the system. The core of the software remains untouched, stable, and oblivious to this major infrastructure change. The technical decision serves the business, without the business becoming a hostage to the technology.\n3. Focus: Developers working on business logic can focus on the business problem (what are the rules for an anniversary event?) without being distracted by the complexities of the infrastructure.\n\nThe SOLID Principles at the Micro Level\n\nIf Clean Architecture is the urban plan for our software city, the SOLID principles are the building codes for each structure. They help us implement the Dependency Rule at the class and module level.\n\n (S) Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. A TaxCalculator class should not be responsible for saving the result to the database. This isolates the impact of changes.\n (O) Open/Closed Principle: Software should be open for extension but closed for modification. Instead of changing an existing class to add a new payment type, you create a new implementation of a PaymentMethod interface. This prevents breaking what already works.\n (L) Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program. This ensures that the abstraction you've created is reliable and that polymorphism works as expected.\n (I) Interface Segregation Principle: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Creating small, focused interfaces (Payable, Refundable) is better than a monolithic FinancialManager interface.\n (D) Dependency Inversion Principle: This is the heart of the Dependency Rule at the code level. Instead of a UserService directly instantiating a PostgresRepository, it depends on an IUserRepository interface. The concrete implementation (Postgres, MongoDB, etc.) is injected from the outside.\n\nThe How: Disciplined Practices for Maintaining Health\n\nHaving a good architectural design is not enough. We need daily disciplines to build and maintain quality.\n\nTest-Driven Development (TDD) is Not About Testing\n\nContrary to its name, the primary benefit of TDD is not the resulting test suite (though that's an excellent side effect). TDD is a design discipline.\n\nThe Red-Green-Refactor cycle forces us to:\n1. Red (Write a failing test): Think first about the desired interface and behavior. What do I want this code to do? How will I use it? This forces the creation of clean, focused APIs.\n2. Green (Write the simplest code to pass the test): Focus on making one thing work, avoiding over-engineering.\n3. Refactor (Improve the code's design): With the safety of the test suite, we can now improve the internal structure of the code. This is where we apply SOLID principles, remove duplication, and increase clarity, knowing we haven't broken anything.\n\nTDD is what makes refactoring safe and, therefore, feasible to practice continuously.\n\nRefactoring: The Continuous Hygiene of Code\n\nMichael Feathers, in Working Effectively with Legacy Code, brilliantly defines legacy code: legacy code is simply code without tests. Why? Because without tests, we cannot refactor it safely.\n\nRefactoring should not be a project scheduled for the next quarter. It should be a continuous practice, like washing the dishes after cooking. It is the Boy Scout Rule applied to software:\n\n> Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.\n\nWhen fixing a bug or adding a small feature, take the opportunity to make a small improvement: rename a variable to be clearer, extract a complex method into smaller ones, break a dependency. This compounding effect of improvements is what prevents the codebase from deteriorating.\n\nThe Culture: The Human Factor and Technical Leadership\n\nNone of the practices above survive in a vacuum. They need to be sustained by an engineering culture that values quality, collaboration, and, crucially, technical leadership.\n\nThe Staff Engineer's Perspective: The Architect and Guardian of Codebase Health\n\nThe existence of a healthy codebase is not an accident but the result of deliberate and persistent technical leadership. In her book The Staff Engineer's Path, Tanya Reilly deconstructs the senior engineer (Staff+) role, showing that their greatest contribution comes not from the volume of code they write, but from their ability to act as a force multiplier for the entire team. In the context of a codebase, this multiplication takes very concrete and profound forms.\n\nLet's abandon the simplistic view that the Staff Engineer just writes the hardest code. Their real job is to ensure that the easy code to write is also the right, sustainable code.\n\n1. Seeing the Forest, Not Just the Trees: Big-Picture Thinking\n\nOne of the fundamental distinctions Reilly points out is the shift from local optimizations to a systemic view.\n\n A Senior Engineer sees a performance problem (an N+1 query, for example), fixes it efficiently, and moves on. The local problem is solved.\n A Staff Engineer sees the same problem and asks, Why did this happen? Why didn't our ORM, our code review tools, or our tests warn us about this? This is the third time this month we've fixed an N+1 issue. Does our data access layer promote this type of error? Do we need a new abstraction or a specific linter to prevent this entire class of bugs in the future?\n\nThis is the application of Big-Picture Thinking. The Staff Engineer isn't just fixing a leak; they are analyzing the entire plumbing system to understand why the pipes keep bursting. For the codebase, this translates to:\n Influencing Architecture: Advocating for architectural changes that eliminate entire classes of problems, rather than applying countless band-aids.\n Defining Technical Strategy: Helping to draw a map of where the codebase needs to evolve in the next 1-2 years to support business goals, identifying the most strategic technical debt to pay down now.\n\n2. The Glue Work: The Invisible Work That Upholds Quality\n\nReilly gives special attention to Glue Work—the often invisible and unglamorous work that connects people, systems, and processes. In a codebase, this glue work is the immune system that keeps it healthy. The Staff Engineer is the primary agent of this work, acting as the guardian of technical quality:\n\n Establishing and Automating Standards: It's not enough to say write tests. The Staff Engineer ensures the CI/CD pipeline is fast, reliable, and blocks code without adequate coverage. They define linting and formatting rules that are applied automatically, making the quality standard the path of least resistance.\n Improving the Developer Experience (DX): A build that takes 15 minutes? A development environment that takes a day to set up? This is friction that encourages shortcuts and frustrates the team. The Staff Engineer invests time in optimizing these tools, knowing that a fast feedback loop is essential for safe refactoring and experimentation.\n Writing the Important Documentation: Not the documentation that repeats what the code already says, but the documentation that explains the why. Documenting an architectural decision, the reasons for choosing one technology over another, or the trade-offs of a complex module. This is the knowledge that prevents future teams from repeating past mistakes.\n\n3. You're a Role Model Now: Leading by Example\n\nThe Staff Engineer leads by example. Their code is not just functional; it is a teaching tool.\n\n Exemplary Pull Requests: Their PRs are clear, well-described, with tests that not only prove functionality but also document behavior. They demonstrate the patterns the team should follow.\n Code Reviews That Raise the Bar: In a code review, they go beyond missing semicolon. They ask strategic questions: Is this new dependency aligned with our long-term vision? Have we considered how this approach will scale? Is there a simpler way to solve this that will be easier for the next developer to maintain? They use the CR as a mentoring opportunity, raising the technical level of the entire team.\n\nIn short, a Staff Engineer's contribution to a friendly and evolvable codebase is less about their individual output and more about creating a socio-technical system where quality is a natural outcome. They don't just build good buildings (features); they design the city (architecture), write the zoning laws (standards), and ensure the transportation routes (pipelines and DX) are efficient for all the other builders. They transform codebase health from a heroic individual effort into a collective, manageable responsibility.\n\nConclusion: An Investment with an Exponential Return\n\nBuilding and maintaining a friendly codebase is not a luxury; it's an economic necessity for any tech company that wants to move quickly and sustainably.\n\nIt is an effort that combines an architecture focused on separation of concerns, daily practices of TDD and refactoring, and a culture of collaboration led by engineers who think systemically. The initial cost of adopting these disciplines is paid back multiple times over by increased development velocity, a decrease in critical bugs, and, perhaps most importantly, a happier and more engaged engineering team.\n\nA healthy codebase is a living organism. It breathes, grows, and adapts. And our job as engineers is to be its best caregivers.\n\n> We talked about staff responsibility, but this extends to all team members (especially leaders). It's important that each team member takes responsibility and works together to maintain healthy code.\n\n---\n\nFurther Reading\n\n Martin, Robert C.

    "content" : "In the universe of software engineering and data science, we operate under the empire of logic and merit. An elegant piece of code, an algorithm that saves millions in cloud costs, or a model that boosts user retention by 5% are irrefutable truths. We believe, almost as an article of faith, that our work will speak for itself. We expect technical excellence to be noticed and, naturally, rewarded. However, for experienced professionals, this is one of the most dangerous fallacies for career growth. Value, no matter how obvious it may seem to you, needs to be translated, communicated, and yes, negotiated.\n\n\n\nThe Anatomy of the Difficult Conversation: Aligning Perceptions of Value\n\nThe root of the problem is rarely bad faith. Your manager is not necessarily trying to undervalue you. The challenge is that you and the leadership are operating with different sets of information and priorities. This is where the teachings of Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most become an essential guide. The book argues that the fundamental mistake we make is assuming difficult conversations are about facts, when they are actually about conflicting perceptions and feelings.\n\n> Difficult conversations are almost never about getting the facts right. They are about conflicting perceptions, interpretations, and values. They are not about what a contract says, but about what a contract means.\n\nFor a technical professional, the What Happened? conversation is our strong suit. You don't say, I worked hard. You say, I led the project to refactor our data pipeline, which reduced latency by 40% and allowed the BI team to generate real-time reports, unlocking X new business initiatives. You use facts, metrics, and business impact as your foundation, separating the person (you) from the problem (the misalignment between contribution and compensation). The challenge is to understand that your facts, however solid, do not represent the whole story for the other party.\n\nStrategic Timing and Tactical Empathy: When and How to Negotiate\n\nOnce you are armed with the data that quantifies your value, the question becomes one of timing. This is where the wisdom of Chris Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator and author of Never Split the Difference, is transformative. Voss teaches that the best moment to negotiate is right after you have created value for the other side. Did you just deliver a critical project ahead of schedule? Did you close a security vulnerability that could have cost millions? That is your moment of maximum leverage. The value you provided is fresh and undeniable.\n\nThe approach, however, is not confrontational. Voss advocates for tactical empathy—understanding your manager's perspective, not to agree with it, but to comprehend it.\n\n> Tactical empathy is understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feelings so you can increase your influence in all the moments that follow.\n\nYour negotiation should be framed as a solution for them. I know that retaining senior talent is a priority for you. I want to continue delivering this level of impact here, and for that to be sustainable for me in the long term, we need to ensure my total compensation reflects this contribution. You are not asking; you are collaborating toward a mutual goal: keeping a high-performing asset (you) motivated and productive.\n\nStrategic Negotiation: When to Accept Less (Temporarily)\n\nWhat if the opportunity of your dreams requires a lateral move or even a small step back in compensation? For an experienced professional, this can be a masterstroke, if done consciously. Perhaps you are migrating from web development to Machine Learning, or you want the experience of scaling a system from 1 million to 100 million users. In these cases, you are negotiating for something beyond salary: experience and career capital.\n\nThe key is to treat this as an explicit negotiation. In the initial conversation, you might say, I understand this is the budget for the position. My goal is to demonstrate X and Y within the next 6 months. Once that value is clearly delivered, I'd like to schedule a conversation to reassess and align my compensation with the market standard for someone with that contribution. This transforms acceptance into a conditional agreement. And to ensure your achievements don't get lost in the day-to-day, the practice of keeping a Brag Document, as popularized by Julia Evans, becomes your most powerful tool. It's not vanity; it's a factual record for a future, data-driven conversation.\n\nConclusion: You Are the Architect of Your Career\n\nFor tech professionals, senior growth transcends the ability to write code or analyze data. It requires the ability to articulate value, influence decisions, and architect one's own career. Negotiating your compensation, especially after delivering significant results, is not an act of confrontation. It is the logical conclusion of your work: ensuring that the system (your career and your company) properly recognizes and rewards the efficiency and value you have injected into it. Your code is brilliant, but it's your voice that will ensure your impact is fully understood and valued.",

    "content" : "This is the conclusion of our series about the evolution of product delivery since 2022. If you haven't read the previous parts, I recommend starting with the first part about technical improvements and then the second part about business impact and user experience, to have the complete context of this analysis.\n\n\n\nWe arrive at the most fascinating and controversial aspect of current software development evolution: how Large Language Models fit into the improvement trajectory we've analyzed. This isn't a peripheral issue; it's central to understanding whether the positive evolution we've documented will continue or if we'll face new challenges that could compromise the gains we've achieved.\n\nThe Role of LLMs: Amplifiers or Distractors of Improvement?\n\nThe emergence of Large Language Models as everyday tools for developers adds a fascinating and complex layer to this evolution. It's impossible to discuss the improvement in deliveries from 2022 to now without addressing how LLMs fit into this trajectory, because they represent both an opportunity and a risk for the continuity of this positive evolution.\n\nLLMs are contributing to improvements in genuinely transformative ways. The acceleration of routine tasks is real and measurably significant. Boilerplate code generation, unit test creation, basic documentation elaboration, and even legacy code refactoring are tasks that can be dramatically accelerated with intelligent use of LLMs. More importantly, this acceleration isn't just about speed; it can effectively free up developers' mental capacity to focus on more complex problems and strategic product thinking.\n\nThe facilitation of exploration and prototyping also represents a qualitative advance. LLMs allow developers to test ideas and approaches more quickly and with lower initial investment, creating space for more experimentation and iteration. This is particularly valuable for product-minded developers, because it allows exploring more alternatives before committing to a specific direction.\n\nHowever, LLMs also introduce risks that require constant vigilance and dramatically reinforce the need for product thinking as a safeguard. The risk of superficiality is real and dangerous. The ease of generating code can seduce developers into accepting solutions without deeply understanding the underlying problem or the solution's implications. This is precisely the type of thinking that the product-minded developer needs to actively combat.\n\nThe quality and security of LLM-generated code varies drastically and doesn't always meet the standards necessary for production software. Human curation, guided by deep understanding of the product and business requirements, becomes not just valuable but essential. Product-minded developers are uniquely positioned to exercise this curation effectively, because they understand not just the code, but the business context and long-term implications of different technical choices.\n\nPerhaps the most subtle but potentially most harmful risk is excessive focus on the tool at the expense of the problem. Enthusiasm for new technologies can divert attention from what really matters: solving real user problems and adding measurable business value. This is a pattern we see repeatedly in the tech industry, and LLMs aren't immune to it.\n\nLLMs are, fundamentally, tools. Powerful and transformative tools, yes, but still tools. Their real value for improving deliveries only materializes when they're guided by strong product thinking. They can help developers build faster, but it's exclusively product thinking that ensures we're building the right thing, in the right way, for the right reason.\n\nConclusion: Enhanced Deliveries Through Strategic Human Intelligence\n\nThe journey from 2022 to today offers compelling evidence that product thinking isn't a passing trend or consulting jargon, but a fundamental pillar for sustainable evolution of software engineering. The improvements we observe in software deliveries whether in speed, strategic alignment with business, or user experience quality are direct reflections of teams and individual developers who have deeply internalized the importance of understanding not just the technical how, but the strategic why and the real impact of their work.\n\nThis evolution is particularly notable because it happened organically, emerging from practice and experience, not from corporate mandates or imposed methodologies. Developers discovered for themselves that when they truly understand the problem they're solving and the value they're creating, their work becomes not just more effective, but more satisfying and meaningful.\n\nLLMs add a fascinating new dimension to this scenario, offering genuine potential to dramatically amplify developers' capabilities. They represent one of the most powerful tools we've ever had available for accelerating software development. However, paradoxically, they also reinforce the critical need for sharp human discernment and clear strategic vision qualities that are inherent to the product-minded developer.\n\nThe fundamental challenge remains unchanged, even in a world with LLMs: utilize all available tools and knowledge not to simply produce more code, but to deliver solutions that truly transform and add lasting, measurable value. The evolution of recent years is clear and encouraging, demonstrating that when developers embrace a product mindset, the entire development ecosystem benefits.\n\nProduct thinking continues to be the compass that guides us in the right direction, especially in a rapidly transforming technological environment. It's not just about writing better code; it's about deeply understanding why we're writing code, for whom, and how our work connects to larger and more meaningful objectives. This understanding is what transforms developers into true value architects, capable of navigating any technological change while maintaining focus on what really matters: creating solutions that make a real difference in people's lives and business success.\n\n> This is the conclusion of the series about product delivery evolution. If you've reached here without reading the previous parts, I recommend starting with the first part and second part for the complete experience.",

    "content" : "If you haven't read the first part of this series about The Silent Revolution, I recommend starting there to understand the complete context of the transformation we're analyzing.\n\n\n\nAfter exploring how technical improvements materialized since 2022, we arrive at the heart of the transformation: the moment when product thinking ceased being an aspirational concept to become an engine of measurable results for both business and user experience.\n\nFocus on Business Impact: From Requirement to Reality\n\nThe most notable transformation since 2022 is perhaps how the focus on business impact migrated from the theoretical realm to everyday practice. In 2022, we talked about the need for this focus; today, we see its concrete materialization in the corridors of tech companies. Product-minded developers are no longer occasional guests in strategic discussions; they've become active and valued participants in product roadmap decisions and business KPI definition.\n\nThis evolution reflects a more mature understanding by leadership that product-minded developers bring a unique and valuable perspective: they understand both technical possibilities and limitations, and can translate business objectives into executable solutions. More importantly, they question assumptions and propose alternatives that purely business stakeholders might not have considered.\n\nThe use of data to guide development has also evolved dramatically. Developers aren't just consuming product usage dashboards; they're actively participating in metrics definition, questioning how new features can be measured in terms of impact on company results, and more critically, using this data to influence technical decisions. They've learned to ask questions like: How will we know if this implementation is working? even before starting to code.\n\nValue-based prioritization has become second nature. The question What's the business impact of this? has evolved from a formal check to a constant mental filter. This change is profound because it fundamentally alters how technical problems are approached. Developers begin evaluating not just the technical elegance of a solution, but its effectiveness in moving business metrics.\n\nThe direct consequence is more consistent and predictable business result delivery. Software ceases to be perceived as a necessary cost center and consolidates as an active growth engine. Whether optimizing existing operations, opening new markets through innovative features, or directly increasing revenue through better conversion and user retention, software developed with product thinking demonstrates tangible and trackable ROI.\n\nUser Experience (Customer) Improvement: The Heart of Value Delivery\n\nUser experience has always been theoretically central to product thinking, but from 2022 onwards, we've witnessed its elevation from concept to practical obsession. Developers have viscerally internalized that every line of code they write has a direct and measurable impact on the customer journey. This awareness has fundamentally transformed collaboration between disciplines.\n\nCollaboration with designers and UX researchers has evolved from functional coordination to true strategic partnership. Product-minded developers have learned that their technical perspective not only complements the design process but often enriches it in unexpected ways. They bring insights about what's technically possible within performance and resource constraints, allowing designers to explore more ambitious and innovative solutions. More importantly, they anticipate technical implications of UX decisions, preventing problems that would only manifest in production.\n\nThis deeper partnership has resulted in a remarkable ability to anticipate user needs and friction points. Developers no longer wait for detailed specifications about edge cases; they identify them proactively, thinking about how real users will interact with the solution under real, not ideal, conditions. They ask questions like: What if the user has slow internet?, What if they try to do this on mobile?, What if they make this common mistake?. This anticipation translates into more robust software and smoother experiences.\n\nThe focus on performance, accessibility, and usability has definitively migrated from the nice-to-have category to an essential component of any delivery. Product-minded developers understand that a slow application is an application that fails in its mission, regardless of how elegant the code might be. They've internalized that accessibility isn't compliance; it's market expansion. They know that usability isn't cosmetic; it's fundamental for adoption and retention.\n\nThe result is software that transcends mere functionality to become genuinely pleasant to use. This isn't a minor achievement; in a saturated market, user experience is often the decisive competitive differentiator. Software developed with this mindset solves users' problems efficiently, contributing directly to customer satisfaction, retention, and advocacy.\n\nBut there's a disruptive element that adds complexity to this entire evolution: the emergence of Large Language Models as everyday tools for developers. In the final part of this series, we'll explore how LLMs fit into this improvement trajectory, representing both an opportunity and a risk for the continuity of this positive evolution, and what this means for the future of software development.\n\n> This is the second part of the series. If you missed the first part, I recommend reading it before continuing. Next week, we'll conclude by exploring the role of LLMs in this evolution.",

    "content" : "In 2022, I dove deep into the crucial importance of Product-Minded Developers. The thesis was simple but powerful: go beyond code for code's sake, focusing on solving real business problems and driving the company toward its objectives. It was about transforming lines of code into tangible value.\n\nFast-forward to today, much has evolved. New technologies, like LLMs, have become ubiquitous, integrating into developers' workflows. But beyond the tools, the fundamental question remains: how has that product mindset translated into concrete improvements in software delivery? What has effectively changed for the better from 2022 to now?\n\nWhat Have We Delivered from 2022 to Today? Continuous and Measurable Improvement\n\nThe transformation we've observed since 2022 in teams that embraced product thinking goes far beyond mere superficial changes in processes. We're witnessing a silent but profound revolution in how software is conceived, developed, and delivered. This evolution manifests first in development cycles, which have become significantly more agile and lean. When developers truly understand the why behind each feature they build, a laser focus naturally emerges on what's essential versus what's merely desirable.\n\nThis deep understanding of purpose results in something business metrics capture immediately: a notable reduction in Time to Market for features that truly move the business needle. It's not just about building faster, but building with strategic intelligence. Teams have organically refined their agile practices, discovering that when each team member understands the impact of their work, deliveries naturally become more frequent and incremental, because there's shared clarity about what constitutes deliverable value.\n\nParallel to this, we observe a fundamental shift in software's adherence to business needs. The constant dialogue between developers and product areas has evolved from a formality to an organic necessity. Product-minded developers don't wait for complete specifications; they ask questions, challenge assumptions, and propose solutions that often surprise business stakeholders with their strategic depth. The result is solutions intrinsically linked to the company's strategic objectives, where every line of code written has a clear and measurable purpose.\n\nQuality, both perceived and technical, has experienced equally impressive evolution. There's an interesting paradox here: when developers care deeply about the problem they're solving, they naturally build more robust and scalable solutions. This isn't coincidence; it's consequence. A deep understanding of the problem leads to more solid architectural decisions, because the developer can anticipate how the solution will need to evolve. The concern shifts from merely it works to encompass it works well, is maintainable, is scalable, and solves the user's problem effectively in the long term.\n\nIndustry data corroborates this evolution. The State of DevOps Report consistently demonstrates that high-performing teams, which generally internalize many product thinking principles like focus on value flow and rapid feedback, continue improving fundamental metrics such as deployment frequency and lead time for changes, while maintaining low failure rates. This isn't a statistical accident; it's empirical evidence that when developers think like product owners, the entire delivery cycle optimizes itself.\n\nBut technical improvements are just one face of this transformation. The real revolution happened when developers began to understand and directly influence business impact and user experience. In the next part of this series, we'll explore how this mindset migrated from the theoretical realm to tangible business results, and how collaboration with other disciplines evolved to create genuinely transformative user experiences.\n\n> This is the first part of a series about the evolution of product delivery.

    "date" : "2025-05-01T00:00:00+00:00",

    "url" : "https://avelino.run/mental-obesity-consuming-knowledge-cognitive-burden",
    "content" : "We live in the age of information, where access to knowledge is virtually limitless. Books, courses, podcasts, articles, videos — everything is just a click away. For ambitious professionals, this abundance seems like a blessing. But increasingly, many people find themselves consuming content relentlessly without applying what they learn in real life. This phenomenon is known as mental obesity.\n\n\n\nWhat Is Mental Obesity?\n\nMental obesity refers to the excessive accumulation of information without proper digestion, reflection, or practical implementation. Just as physical obesity results from consuming more calories than the body can burn, mental obesity stems from absorbing more knowledge than the mind can process or transform into action.\n\nThis concept is closely linked to cognitive overload, a state where the brain’s processing capacity is exceeded, leading to mental fatigue, difficulty focusing, impaired learning, and reduced productivity. According to John Sweller's Cognitive Load Theory, the human brain has a limited working memory, and overwhelming it with disconnected content compromises both decision-making and long-term retention.\n\nThe Trap of Knowledge Without Execution\n\nIn high-performance environments — particularly startups and tech-driven companies — it's common to see people chasing non-stop learning. But without active application, this accumulation of knowledge often leads to frustration, the illusion of progress, and a paralyzing sense of stagnation.\n\nAs shown in a study published in Ciência & Saúde Coletiva, mere knowledge acquisition is not sufficient to produce behavioral change. Transformation requires embodiment — turning theory into lived experience.\n🔗 Access the article\n\nPsychological Effects of Mental Obesity: The Mind Under Constant Pressure\n\nMental obesity is not just a metaphor — it’s a phenomenon with real psychological consequences. Continuous exposure to high volumes of information without pauses or reflection creates a state of chronic hyperstimulation. The prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive functions like planning, decision-making, and inhibitory control, becomes overloaded. This often leads to declining mental clarity, diminished analytical capacity, and difficulty in setting priorities.\n\nOne of the most common effects is the emergence of persistent diffuse anxiety — often described as the feeling of always being behind or not keeping up with the world. This is exacerbated by constant comparisons, especially in digital environments, and by an internalized fear of falling behind. As the brain saturates with inputs and lacks integration time, it either shuts down (procrastination) or goes into hyperdrive (workaholism), both dysfunctional coping mechanisms.\n\nAnother critical impact is the erosion of cognitive self-esteem. When we consume high-quality knowledge — technical books, advanced courses, dense academic papers — but fail to turn it into action, we start to question our own competence: Maybe I’m not as capable as I thought? This disconnect between intention and behavior can trigger cycles of self-doubt, reinforcing a mismatch between identity and performance. Over time, this contributes to demotivation, powerlessness, and in more severe cases, cognitive burnout — a mental exhaustion not from work volume, but from unprocessed knowledge.\n\nThere's also the issue of psychic fragmentation. The human mind thrives on narrative integration — the ability to weave information into meaningful context. When flooded with disconnected content, the mind struggles to create coherence. The result? Scattered thinking, impaired sustained attention, and ironically, lower creativity, since true creativity requires synthesis and symbolic depth — both undermined by informational excess.\n\nUltimately, the solution isn’t simply to consume less, but to relearn how to consume: to prioritize depth over breadth, action over accumulation, and integration over superficiality. Knowledge must return to being a tool for transformation, not a product for collection.\n\nCognitive Symptoms Checklist\n\nIf you suspect you're experiencing mental obesity, here are a few indicators:\n\n- You consume more content than you apply.\n- You feel guilty for not reading more — even after finishing a book.\n- You constantly start new courses but rarely finish or implement them.\n- You feel stuck or anxious despite learning “a lot.”\n- You struggle to focus or retrieve what you’ve read just days before.\n\nStrategies to Reverse Mental Obesity\n\n1. Act Before You Accumulate More\n   Don’t read a second article before acting on the first. Execution must precede further intake.\n2. Set Transformation Goals\n   Don’t just set goals to learn X; define what you’ll do differently once you learn it.\n3. Reintroduce Cognitive Fasting\n   Take regular breaks from content. Let your mind breathe and synthesize ideas.\n4. Reread and Reflect\n   Repetition deepens integration. Instead of consuming something new, re-engage with material and connect it to real-life challenges.\n5. Practice Contextual Learning\n   Read only what’s directly applicable to your current problem — and test it immediately.\n\n🚀 Final Thoughts: Learning as a Tool, Not an Escape\n\nTrue learning is transformative, not performative. In a culture that often celebrates reading volume or certifications, we must remember that accumulation without transformation is intellectual stagnation. Knowledge should not be a refuge from action, but a catalyst for it.\n\nMental obesity is the result of a system — personal and social — that values appearing informed more than being changed. To fight it, we must reframe our relationship with knowledge and reclaim the discipline of depth.\n\n---\n\n🧠 Scientific References\n\n- Sweller, J. (1988).

    "content" : "Experienced leaders know that giving feedback is not about pointing out mistakes — it's about fostering development without damaging psychological safety. The practice of waiting up to 48 hours after an incident to give feedback is rooted not just in behavioral wisdom but also in neuroscience.\n\n\n\nThis article deeply explores, through the lens of _Your Brain at Work_ (Amazon), by organizational neuroscientist David Rock, the brain mechanisms that make this time window the most effective for transforming feedback into growth — not trauma.\n\nThe Biology of Threat: Why the Brain Rejects Poorly Timed Feedback\n\nWhen receiving feedback, the brain doesn't just process information — it evaluates social threat in milliseconds. According to Rock, criticism or correction can be perceived as a status threat, activating the limbic system, specifically the amygdala, the brain's fear and threat detection center.\n\n> _The human brain responds to social threats with the same intensity as it does to physical threats._\n> — David Rock\n\nIn this state, the employee becomes defensive, impairing active listening, working memory, and rational processing. Trying to coach someone in this state is like trying to teach during a fire drill — survival trumps learning.\n\nWaiting 48 hours allows the amygdala to calm down and gives the prefrontal cortex — responsible for executive function and empathy — a chance to take control.\n\nThe SCARF Model: Engineering a Safer Feedback Conversation\n\nDavid Rock's SCARF model explains how the brain reacts to five social domains:\n\n1. Status – perception of relative importance.\n2. Certainty – ability to predict the future.\n3. Autonomy – sense of control over events.\n4. Relatedness – sense of social connection.\n5. Fairness – perception of fair exchanges.\n\nPoorly timed feedback can threaten several of these simultaneously. Thoughtful feedback, given with intent, space, and structure, mitigates these threats and engages the brain cognitively, not reactively.\n\nHow the 48-hour delay helps:\n\n- Scheduling the conversation reinforces Certainty.\n- Sharing context and facts strengthens Fairness and Relatedness.\n- Inviting collaboration supports Autonomy.\n\nThis creates a space of learning rather than defensiveness.\n\nNeurophysiology of Emotional Regulation: Why Time Matters\n\nRock introduces the concept of the refractory state — a period after emotional activation when:\n\n- People cannot process new information effectively;\n- Working memory is impaired;\n- Focus is on self-protection, not learning.\n\n> _It's futile to rationalize with someone in a refractory state. They may hear your words, but they're not processing them._\n> — David Rock\n\nWaiting 48 hours ensures that both leader and employee exit the refractory state, enabling a conversation grounded in awareness, cognition, and empathy.\n\nContextual Memory and Feedback Validity\n\nRock also stresses the importance of episodic memory in meaningful feedback. After 2–3 days:\n\n- Leaders may forget important nuances;\n- Employees may reinterpret or mentally close the event;\n- Feedback may feel disconnected or punitive.\n\nThe 48-hour window balances recency (preserving contextual memory) and emotional regulation, maximizing feedback impact.\n\nHow to Apply This in Leadership Practice\n\nDay 0 (incident):\n\n- Document the facts, context, and consequences.\n- Avoid emotional or spontaneous feedback.\n\nDay 1 (reflection):\n\n- Reassess the true impact and intention.\n- Draft your message based on facts, not judgments.\n- Plan a SCARF-aware conversation.\n\nDay 2 (delivery):\n\n- Schedule and create a safe space for the dialogue.\n- Use frameworks like SBI (Situation, Behavior, Impact).\n- Invite reflection and co-create next steps.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe 48-hour rule for giving feedback is more than a best practice — it's applied neuroscience in leadership. Instead of reacting and risking trust, leaders who respect this window elevate themselves as intentional, conscious, and effective communicators.\n\nGreat leaders don't just correct — they shape safer, sharper, and more self-aware brains.",

    "content" : "In the open source ecosystem, code is often celebrated as the star. However, behind every thriving open source project lies a less visible yet crucial factor: effective communication. Successful maintainers recognize that writing good code is just a small fraction of their responsibility; their primary role revolves around fostering community engagement, clarifying project goals, and facilitating collaboration.\n\n\n\nWhy Communication Trumps Code in Open Source Maintenance\n\nOpen source maintainers face the dual challenge of advancing technical excellence while simultaneously nurturing a vibrant community. Nadia Eghbal, in her seminal work Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software, highlights this evolution, stressing that maintainers today spend significantly more time managing communication channels, contributions, and relationships than simply coding.\n\nPractical examples from successful projects like Awesome-Go underscore the value of communication-driven maintenance. Awesome-Go is more than a curated list; it's a hub of engagement that demonstrates how clear guidelines and active interactions amplify community contributions. The project’s effective communication strategies include:\n\n- Clear Contribution Guidelines: Awesome-Go provides explicit instructions on how contributors can propose new additions, update content, and even remove outdated entries. This transparency significantly reduces barriers for newcomers.\n\n- Transparent Roadmaps and Decisions: Each decision on whether a library or tool gets added is transparently discussed in public issues and pull requests. Contributors always understand why certain items are accepted or rejected, which maintains trust and accountability.\n\n- Community-Driven Documentation: By keeping documentation clear and continuously updated through community input, Awesome-Go ensures that its content remains reliable and accessible. This transforms documentation into a powerful asynchronous communication channel.\n\nBuilding a Robust Communication Framework\n\nIn The Art of Community, Jono Bacon emphasizes communication infrastructure as essential to a project's longevity and health. Effective open source projects cultivate clear, responsive communication channels—such as issue trackers, forums, chat platforms (like Slack, Discord, or Matrix), and mailing lists—that make contributors feel acknowledged and valued.\n\nFor instance, Awesome-Go leverages GitHub Issues extensively not only for discussing the quality of libraries but also for engaging contributors through constructive feedback and mentorship. This proactive engagement encourages continuous, high-quality participation.\n\nPractical Tips to Enhance Communication in Your Project\n\nTo elevate communication in your open source project, consider the following practical steps:\n\n1. Establish Clear Contribution Processes: Clearly document how users can get involved, what contributions are needed, and how decisions are made.\n\n2. Actively Facilitate Discussions: Regularly engage with contributors by promptly responding to questions, feedback, and issues. Acknowledging contributions, even small ones, fosters a welcoming environment.\n\n3. Invest in Comprehensive Documentation: View documentation as a living communication channel. Keep it updated, clear, and community-driven to encourage continuous improvement.\n\n4. Regularly Communicate Vision and Goals: Ensure contributors understand the project’s direction by maintaining and sharing transparent, frequently updated roadmaps.\n\nWhen a potential contributor asks, Where can I help? it often signals a need for clearer communication. Successful projects proactively anticipate this question, guiding contributors seamlessly toward impactful involvement.\n\nBy prioritizing communication, open source projects like Awesome-Go transform passive users into dedicated advocates and active community participants, ultimately ensuring the project’s sustainability and growth.",

This discrepancy creates what psychologists call attention poverty – a condition where our cognitive capacity is constantly fragmented among multiple stimuli.\n\nModern neuroscience confirms: the human brain was not designed for multitasking. When we try to process multiple streams of information simultaneously, we aren't really performing parallel tasks, but rather rapidly switching between them, with a significant cognitive cost. Each switch represents a small death of deep focus, a phenomenon that neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley calls task-switching cost.\n\nThis cost is not trivial. Studies from Stanford University demonstrate that people who frequently switch between multiple tasks show reduced capacity to filter irrelevant information, compromised working memory, and greater difficulty switching between tasks – creating a vicious cycle of chronic distraction.\n\nThe Illusion of Busy Productivity\n\nOur culture celebrates constant busyness as synonymous with productivity, creating what philosopher Byung-Chul Han calls the burnout society. We are perpetually exhausted, not from producing meaningful results, but from the continuous effort to process an overwhelming volume of stimuli.\n\nGreg McKeown, in Essentialism, identifies this phenomenon as the busyness fallacy – confusing movement with progress. True productivity, McKeown argues, is not about doing more, but doing the right thing – that which significantly moves the needle toward our most important objectives. Source\n\nThis distinction is crucial: activity is not accomplishment. As Peter Drucker astutely observed: There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.\n\nThe Neuroscience of Deep Focus\n\nTo understand the value of focus, we must understand how our brain processes information. When we engage in deep work – periods of intense concentration without distractions – we activate what neuroscientists call the executive attention network, a neural system that enables complex thinking, problem-solving, and creativity.\n\nCal Newport, in Deep Work, presents compelling evidence that this capacity for deep concentration is not just a preference in work style, but a neurological requirement for producing work of exceptional value. Myelination – the biological process that strengthens neural connections – occurs most efficiently during periods of sustained attention. Source\n\nParadoxically, as digital tools make shallow work easier, the capacity for deep work becomes simultaneously rarer and more valuable. As Newport observes: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare precisely at the time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.\n\nThe Architecture of Distraction: Understanding the Adversary\n\nTo effectively combat distractions, we must first understand their anatomy. Nir Eyal, in Indistractable, offers a useful taxonomy, categorizing distractions as external and internal. Source\n\nExternal Distractions: The Environment Conspires Against Focus\n\nExternal distractions are evident: notifications, interruptions, environmental noise. Less obvious is how these distractions are meticulously designed to capture our attention. As Tristan Harris, former Google ethical designer, reveals: Thousands of engineers work daily to make these technologies more persuasive and difficult to resist.\n\nThe attention economy is not accidental; it's architected. Apps and platforms are deliberately designed to maximize screen time through mechanisms such as:\n\n- Variable rewards: Notifications and updates that arrive at unpredictable intervals, creating the same dopamine pattern that makes slot machines addictive\n- Social reciprocity: Mechanisms that exploit our evolutionary need to respond to social interactions\n- Fear of missing out: Interfaces that exploit our aversion to loss, creating anxiety about what we might be missing\n\nInternal Distractions: The Enemy Within\n\nMore insidious than external distractions are the internal ones – those impulses that arise from within. As Eyal observes, most distractions begin internally, with emotional discomfort that we seek to alleviate through escape behaviors.\n\nResearch by Matthew Killingsworth and Daniel Gilbert of Harvard University revealed that we spend almost 47% of our waking hours with our mind wandering. This default mode of thinking is associated with lower levels of happiness and reduced productivity.\n\nMindfulness meditation offers a window into this phenomenon. Experienced practitioners report not the absence of distractive thoughts, but a greater ability to observe them without identifying with them. As Jon Kabat-Zinn, pioneer of mindfulness-based meditation, explains: You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf.\n\nAdvanced Strategies to Eliminate Distractions\n\nWith this deeper understanding, we can develop more sophisticated interventions to cultivate focus:\n\n1. Redesigning the Choice Architecture\n\nBehavioral psychologist Richard Thaler introduced the concept of choice architecture – the idea that the way options are presented profoundly influences our decisions. We can apply this principle to create environments that favor focus:\n\n- Asymmetric friction: Deliberately increase friction for distractive behaviors (e.g., removing social media apps from your phone, requiring login via browser) while reducing friction for deep work (e.g., preparing work materials in advance)\n- Powerful defaults: Configure your environment so that the default behavior is focus, not distraction (e.g., site blockers activated by default during work hours)\n- Contextual cues: Create rituals and signals that indicate to the brain when it's time to focus (e.g., a dedicated workspace, specific music, or even a piece of clothing that symbolizes deep work mode)\n\n2. Energy Management, Not Just Time Management\n\nJim Loehr and Tony Schwartz, in The Power of Full Engagement, argue convincingly that energy, not time, is the fundamental resource of productivity. We may have 24 hours a day, but our cognitive energy is finite and fluctuating.\n\nAdvanced energy management strategies include:\n\n- Circadian alignment: Identify your natural periods of cognitive peak (usually 2-4 hours after waking for most people) and fiercely protect these periods for deep work\n- Strategic oscillation: Deliberately alternate between periods of intense focus (usually 90-120 minutes) and complete recovery, respecting the body's natural ultradian cycles\n- Cognitive nutrition: Recognize that certain activities fuel our attention capacity (e.g., moderate exercise, adequate sleep, meaningful social interaction) while others deplete it (e.g., trivial decisions, unresolved conflicts)\n\n3. Cultivating High-Quality Relationships\n\nSocial network researcher Nicholas Christakis has demonstrated that behaviors, emotions, and even concentration levels are contagious within social networks. His research reveals that we are significantly more likely to adopt the habits of the people we spend the most time with.\n\nStrategies for cultivating a social ecosystem that supports focus include:\n\n- Communities of practice: Join groups of people committed to deep work and deliberate growth\n- Social contracts: Establish explicit agreements with colleagues about availability and response expectations\n- Strategic distancing: Consciously reduce exposure to people whose distraction habits are incompatible with your goals\n\nAs Jim Rohn observed: You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. Choose wisely.\n\n4. Transcending the Focus/Distraction Dichotomy\n\nThe most advanced practitioners of focus recognize that true mastery is not about completely eliminating distraction, but about developing a more sophisticated relationship with attention.\n\nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi, in his research on the state of flow, discovered that optimal engagement occurs when we alternate between intense focus and periods of mental diffusion – what neuroscientists call the default network mode. This mode, far from being unproductive, is essential for creativity, knowledge integration, and complex problem-solving.\n\nBarbara Oakley, in A Mind for Numbers, calls this alternating between focused and diffuse modes of thinking. True cognitive mastery comes not from the relentless suppression of distraction, but from the ability to navigate fluidly between these complementary modes.\n\nThe Practice of Discernment: The Essential Meta-Skill\n\nAt the center of all these strategies is a fundamental meta-skill: discernment. As Gary Keller argues in The ONE Thing, the question is not simply to eliminate distractions, but to identify what deserves our attention in the first place. Source\n\nDiscernment requires deep self-knowledge – clarity about your values, purpose, and objectives. As Peter Drucker observed: There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently what should not be done at all.\n\nQuestions to cultivate discernment include:\n\n1. What is my unique contribution? What can I do that combines my talents, passions, and what the world needs?\n\n2. What can I eliminate without consequences? Which activities, if abandoned completely, would not have a significant negative impact?\n\n3. Where is the leverage? Which few activities produce the majority of valuable results?\n\nJames Clear, in Atomic Habits, reminds us that small consistent improvements lead to extraordinary results over time. Applying this principle to focus, we can see that a radical immediate transformation is not necessary, but rather a commitment to the incremental improvement of our attention capacity. Source\n\nConclusion: Attention as Spiritual Practice\n\nAt a deeper level, the practice of focus transcends productivity and touches the spiritual domain. As Simone Weil wrote: Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity.\n\nWhen we deliberately choose where to direct our attention, we are essentially deciding what we will allow to shape our consciousness. In this sense, attention management is not just a productivity technique, but an existential practice – an affirmation of what we value and who we choose to be.\n\nIn a world that incessantly competes for our attention, the ability to consciously direct our focus may be the most radical act of self-determination available to us. As William James, the father of American psychology, observed: My experience is what I agree to attend to.\n\nBy eliminating distractions and cultivating deep focus, we are not just optimizing our productivity – we are reclaiming our cognitive autonomy and creating space for what is truly meaningful to flourish in our lives.\n\n---\n\nKeywords: deep focus, elimination of distractions, cognitive productivity, selective attention, essentialism\n\n---\n\nBibliographic References:\n\n1.

    "content" : "Have you ever stopped to think about how the people around you influence your life?\nOften, we get used to certain companions without realizing that they might be harming us. In this post, we'll explore the importance of carefully selecting the people we surround ourselves with and how this can positively impact our well-being.\n\nWhy select your company?\n\nLiving with toxic, negative people or those who don't share our values can generate stress, anxiety and even low self-esteem. These relationships can drain our energy, prevent us from achieving our goals and compromise our happiness.\n\nOn the other hand, surrounding ourselves with positive people, who support and inspire us, can boost our personal and professional growth, increase our self-confidence and provide us with a lighter and happier life.\n\nHow to identify people who don't do you good?\n\n Pay attention to how you feel: After interacting with certain people, do you feel more energized or more exhausted? More motivated or more demotivated? If the answer is negative, maybe it's time to rethink that relationship.\n Observe patterns of behavior: Toxic people often exhibit behaviors such as constant negativity, excessive criticism, lack of empathy and disrespect for boundaries.\n Trust your intuition: Sometimes, we feel that something is wrong in a relationship, even without knowing how to explain why. Trust your instincts and don't ignore these signs.\n\nHow to distance yourself from toxic people?\n\n Set clear boundaries: Communicate your needs and boundaries assertively and don't allow them to be disrespected.\n Learn to say no: Don't feel obligated to accept invitations or requests that make you feel uncomfortable.\n Seek support: Talk to friends, family or a professional about your difficulties and ask for help to deal with these situations.\n Prioritize your well-being: Remember that you have the right to distance yourself from people who harm you.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that some relationships may never be more than circles of laughter.\n\nWhile deep, meaningful connections are essential, it's also healthy to have friends with whom you can simply relax, have fun, and share lighthearted moments. These relationships can be a source of joy and stress relief, even if they don't necessarily involve deep emotional intimacy.\n\nImportant references\n\nTo deepen your view of healthy interpersonal relationships, I recommend reading the books:\n\n How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie: A classic guide to building positive and meaningful relationships.\n Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman*: Will help you better understand your emotions and those of other people, making it easier to recognize harmful relationships.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSelecting the people around us is an act of self-love and care for our mental and emotional health. By prioritizing our well-being and distancing ourselves from toxic people, we open space for healthier, happier and more meaningful relationships.\n\n> remember: you deserve to be surrounded by people who do you good!",

    "content" : "During a Go conference, an experiment was born that no one could have predicted its educational reach. RumLang emerged not from an elaborate plan, but from the confluence between a love for Common Lisp and the opportune moment of a Go conference. This functional language, which harmonizes Lisp's elegance with the practicality of the Go ecosystem, demonstrates how moments of creativity can transcend their modest origins.\n\nThe Theoretical Foundation\n\nProgramming language development has a rich academic tradition, documented in seminal works such as Concepts of Programming Languages by Robert W. Sebesta Source and Programming Language Pragmatics by Michael L. Scott Source. RumLang, although born as a playful experiment, incorporates fundamental principles from these works in its implementation.\n\nThe Power of Open Source in Academia\n\nWhat makes RumLang's story particularly fascinating is its journey from experimentation to the classroom. This path reflects a larger trend in computer science education, where open source projects serve as bridges between theory and practice. As detailed in The Architecture of Open Source Applications Source, the transparency of open source provides unique learning opportunities.\n\nUnexpected Educational Impact\n\nRumLang's adoption as study material in universities both within and outside Brazil demonstrates an interesting phenomenon: educational value can emerge from unexpected sources. This transition from experiment to teaching tool exemplifies what Peter Seibel explores in Practical Common Lisp Source - Lisp's ability to serve as a vehicle for deep understanding of programming concepts.\n\nThe Future and Lessons Learned\n\nRumLang, available at <https://github.com/rumlang/rum>, stands as a testament to the transformative potential of open source. Its story teaches us that a project's value isn't measured solely by conventional metrics of success, but also by its educational impact and ability to inspire.\n\nThe project demonstrates how the combination of:\n\n Free experimentation\n Open source\n Foundation in classical principles\n Integration with modern technologies\n\ncan create valuable educational tools, even when that wasn't the initial goal.\n\nConclusion\n\nRumLang's journey is a powerful reminder that innovation and educational impact can emerge from the most unexpected places. What began as a playful experiment during a conference transformed into a case study that inspires students and educators, proving that the true value of open source transcends its original intentions.\n\nThis story teaches us that, in the software development world, today's experiments can become tomorrow's educational tools, as long as they're openly shared with the community. RumLang continues as a living example of how unpretentious experimentation, when combined with the power of open source, can create waves of impact that extend far beyond its modest origins.",

    "content" : "Strategic non-action during critical management moments isn't merely a decision absence but a sophisticated leadership approach. According to Amy Edmondson, Harvard Business School professor, this approach is intrinsically linked to building psychological safety in teams, allowing natural patterns of leadership and collaboration to emerge organically.\n\nThe Immediate Replacement Myth\n\nThe pressure to quickly fill vacant leadership positions often leads to hasty decisions. McKinsey research shows that resilient organizations are built on foundations of psychological safety, adaptable leadership, and cohesive culture - elements that cannot be instantly imported through external hires.\n\nThe Value of Strategic Observation\n\nThe strategic pause following a key leadership departure offers substantial benefits:\n\n1. Team Maturity Assessment\n\n- Reveals real team dynamics under pressure\n- Exposes natural problem-solving mechanisms\n- Shows communication patterns without formal hierarchy\n\n2. Leadership Emergence\n\n- Identifies natural leaders and their spheres of influence\n- Reveals knowledge-sharing patterns\n- Demonstrates initiative-taking capabilities\n\n3. Cultural Alignment\n\n- Exposes true organizational values alignment\n- Shows commitment to company mission\n- Reveals authentic team dynamics\n\n4. Risk Mitigation\n\n- Prevents rushed promotion decisions\n- Avoids cultural mismatches\n- Reduces the risk of failed leadership transitions\n\nBuilding a Continuous Learning Environment\n\nThe temporary absence of formal leadership can create a unique environment for developing collective competencies:\n\nSelf-Organization Patterns\n\n- Natural workflow optimization\n- Spontaneous knowledge sharing\n- Organic problem-solving mechanisms\n\nSkill Development\n\n- Cross-functional collaboration\n- Emergency response capabilities\n- Leadership skill emergence\n\nTransforming Non-Action into Strategy\n\nTo effectively implement a strategic pause:\n\n1.

    "content" : "In the fast-paced world of startups and agile companies, one of the most valuable learnings is: don't get attached to a project or product. This advice is crucial to ensure that teams remain focused on delivering value to the business, rather than clinging to solutions that no longer add value.\n\nWhy not get attached?\n\nIn a startup, the ability to adapt is essential. If a product is not generating the expected user engagement, persisting in its development can result in maintenance costs without return. As Eric Ries discusses in The Lean Startup, it is vital that companies are able to pivot quickly, redirecting efforts to initiatives that truly meet market needs and contribute to the company's strategic goals.\n\nThe agile perspective\n\nThe agile philosophy, as described by Jeff Sutherland in Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time, encourages teams to iterate quickly and learn from each development cycle. This means that even if a project was started with enthusiasm, it must be constantly reassessed to ensure it still makes sense in the current context and is aligned with delivering business value.\n\nPersonal and professional growth\n\nLetting go of a project not only benefits the organization but also offers significant opportunities for personal and professional growth. Each project is a chance to learn, evolve technically, and enhance interpersonal skills. Martin Fowler, in Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, emphasizes the importance of reflecting on the work done to identify areas for improvement and create more efficient and reusable solutions.\n\nReflection and continuous learning\n\nUpon completing a project, it is crucial to reflect on what has been done. Questions like Why did we prioritize this? and Why is this task a priority? should be asked regularly. This practice not only improves the quality of work but also ensures that daily activities are aligned with the company's strategic objectives. This is fundamental to ensuring that the focus remains on delivering value.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe role of a developer in a startup goes beyond just writing code. It's about deeply understanding business objectives and adapting actions to better meet them. Letting go of projects is not about discarding hard work, but rather about prioritizing what truly matters and being open to new opportunities for learning and growth.\n\nBy applying these principles, we can significantly contribute to organizational success while evolving as complete professionals, capable of facing the challenges of an agile and constantly changing work environment.\n\nReferences\n\n Sutherland, J.

    "content" : "These days, the line between our offline and online interactions is super blurry. But have you ever thought about what we actually remember from these interactions? Let’s dive into why a lot of our conversations and posts lose their importance over time.\n\nMemory in Real-Life Interactions\n\nDo you remember everything from your last hangout with friends? Probably not. An old study by Ebbinghaus (1885) showed that we forget info quickly if we don't reinforce it. Plus, Daniel Kahneman's book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, explains that our memory only keeps the stuff with the most emotional impact.\n\nSo, it's normal to remember the chats that had a special meaning at that time in your life. The rest, even if it was fun, just fades away.\n\nThe Past on Social Media\n\nOn social media, especially Twitter, this happens way faster. A tweet's life is basically a few minutes. A study by Wiselytics in 2014 found that most tweets lose their visibility in less than 20 minutes.\n\nBut still, we don’t delete our old posts. Why not? Maybe because these posts are like a public diary of our thoughts and experiences. Even when they’re irrelevant, they show how we’ve grown and changed.\n\nWhat Really Matters\n\nIf we forget most stuff in both real-life and online interactions, then what truly matters? Is it really necessary to keep a digital history? Or do these records have some symbolic value that still makes them part of who we are?\n\nThink about it: Do you remember every detail from your last friends' hangout? Or just what really mattered at that point in your life? And on social media, how many old tweets still mean something to you today?\n\nConclusion\n\nIn both real-life and social media interactions, we forget a lot of what we experience. What truly matters are the moments that leave a lasting impact. Understanding this helps us focus on what’s important and let the rest go.\n\n> This is the reason I don't keep a history of tweets on x.com, it doesn't make sense. What really matters is what is happening now, what is being discussed now. What was discussed yesterday no longer matters.",

    "content" : "We usually kick off (or get involved in) open source projects because we have a need and believe our problem, in an abstract form, could also solve issues for others. We’re driven by endorphins (or whatever kind of motivation) and start cranking out code like there’s no tomorrow.\nHowever, it doesn’t take long to realize that just focusing on the code isn’t sustainable. We need proper documentation to help people use and chip in on the project. After months of working solo, a few folks might show interest – that’s when the repository transitions into a true open source project.\n\nThe Difference between Open Source and Open Repository\n\n Open Repository: It’s like a luxury project where you and a handful of people (maybe friends or folks who can’t say no to you) contribute sporadically;\n Open Source: This is when there’s an active community involved, not just you.\n\nIn practice, an open repository can be seen as a personal collection shared with others, whereas an open source project is a vibrant ecosystem where diverse people collaborate, bringing ideas and continuous improvements. For instance, Linux is a stellar example of an open source project shaped by a global community.\n\nWhy Projects Die?\n\nIt’s super common in software engineering to lose the original need for a project after a few months or years. Problems evolve, and we need to think about new solutions and ways to tackle current challenges. Without a community to help maintain and evolve the project, it can die out due to neglect.\n\nOne project I’m proud of building a strong community around is awesome-go. It’s not an easy task to motivate engineers to contribute and help maintain it. Reviewing PRs (pull requests) and manually validating if new additions meet the established criteria is tedious. However, focusing on the positive impact we have on the Go language community keeps maintainers motivated.\n\nWhen to Open Source a Project?\n\nWhen I face the decision of whether or not to invest my time in a new open source project, it is important for me to have a strong overview of already existing alternatives. If there are none, then it is probably a good idea. Otherwise, I think about how changes to my project, by means of approach, architecture, design, etc., could withstand the challenges of competition. However, in most cases, it is a better idea to restructure the existing project instead of writing a new package or library from scratch, whether it is private or open source.\n\nChecklist for Deciding to Open Source a Project:\n\n1. Community Demand: Is there a clear, recurring need for the problem your project solves?\n1. Sustainability: Do you have the time and resources (or partners) to maintain the project in the medium and long term?\n1. Documentation: Does your project have clear and comprehensible documentation?\n1. Contribution Interest: Is there potential interest from other developers to contribute to the project?\n1. Complementarity: Are there similar projects out there? If so, does your project add enough value to justify a new development?\n1. Licensing: Is the open source license you plan to use suitable for what you expect from your project?\n\nLastly, it’s worth reflecting on Eric S. Raymond’s thoughts from his book, The Cathedral and the Bazaar (1999), where he outlines the principles of open source development and how an active community can transform a personal project into something influential.\n\nOpening and maintaining an open source project is a constant challenge that demands more than just coding. You need to build an engaged community, have a solid documentation strategy, and, above all, have the resilience to keep improving and adapting the project to new needs.\n\n> By keeping these guidelines and strategies in mind, you can overcome challenges and ensure the sustainability of your open source project, making sure it stays relevant and useful for a long time.",

    "content" : "In the career evolution of a software engineer, an increase in technical skill and the ability to solve complex problems is observed, as well as a significant expansion in the scope of their responsibilities. As engineers advance to more senior roles – including positions like Staff Engineer – it becomes imperative to align even more closely with the business metrics and objectives of the organization. But why is this alignment so crucial, and how does it manifest in practice?\n\nUnderstanding the Impact Beyond the Code\n\nFor engineers at the beginning of their career, the focus tends to be primarily technical: writing clean code, adhering to best practices, and solving the problem at hand. However, as one advances, the ability to understand the why behind the code becomes equally important. Senior engineers, and especially Staff Engineers, must be able to comprehend how their technical decisions directly impact business metrics, whether they are aimed at increasing revenue, optimizing costs, or improving user experience.\n\nProximity to the Business\n\nBeing close to business metrics implies active participation in strategy definition processes and decision-making. Engineers at more advanced levels are expected to:\n\n Understand Business Goals: Have clarity about what the organization aims to achieve and how technology can be a vector for these objectives;\n Influence Technical Directions: Use their technical expertise to guide decisions that optimize business outcomes, without neglecting the quality and sustainability of the software;\n Monitor and Interpret Metrics: Be capable of interpreting performance data and using it to propose improvements and innovations that leverage business objectives.\n\nStrategic Protagonism\n\nThe position of Staff Engineer confers a strategic protagonism within organizations. This is a figure that transcends the barriers of specific teams and possesses a holistic view of engineering and its intersection with other areas of the company. This professional should not only be involved in the modeling of technical solutions but is also fundamental for:\n\n Promoting a Metrics Culture: Encourage the team to adopt a business-oriented mindset, where success is measured not only in lines of code but in the impact generated;\n* Ensure Cross-Functional Alignment: Facilitate communication between engineering and other areas of the company, ensuring that everyone is moving in the same direction.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs software engineers progress in their careers, there is an increasing need for a deep understanding and direct action on business metrics and objectives. For Staff Engineers, this is not just an expectation but an intrinsic necessity of the role they play. Their success is not measured only by the code they write but by the tangible impact they generate on the company's growth and innovation. After all, at the intersection of technology and business lie both the greatest challenges and the most significant opportunities for creating value.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

    "content" : "> A large part of the people who read my texts are software engineers, so I decided to write speaking to them (software engineers), most likely you! 😊\n\nSoftware engineers are no exception when it comes to avoiding the unknown and uncertainty. Biological, psychological, and sociocultural inclinations interact to keep software engineers in a psychological comfort zone.\n\nEvolutionary Adaptation\n\nWe humans naturally favor the safety of familiarity. Our evolutionary past has shaped our brain to favor the known at the expense of the unknown. For a software engineer, this may manifest as a hesitation to learn a new programming language or adopt new methodologies.\n\nMotivation for Permanence: Evolution and Survival (in Spanish), the article explores the evolution of the comfort zone, by testing pedestrians walking on a busy street. It suggests that the comfort zone is an evolutionary adaptation that has assisted our survival.\n\nWhenever pedestrians walk through a busy street, they are continuously avoiding collisions with incoming pedestrians. Before an encounter ends in a collision, the pedestrian decides - unconsciously - to change their route to prevent colliding with another pedestrian.\n\nPhysicists from the Eindhoven University of Technology, in collaboration with researchers from the United States and Italy, analyzed 5 million pedestrian movements at the Eindhoven train station in the Netherlands. Thanks to the research, the experts discovered that people prefer to maintain - on average - a distance of at least 75 centimeters.\n\nThe Energetic Cost of Change\n\nNeuroscience shows that the brain prefers to conserve energy. When a software engineer needs to learn a new technology or change their programming style, it forces the brain to create new neural connections and discard the old ones. This is more difficult and requires more energy than simply following what is already known.\n\nHomeostasis and Balance: Biology of the Comfort Zone (in Spanish), the article explores why it is essential to be in an uncomfortable zone seeking learning and professional evolution, emphasizing that the comfort zone is a state of biological balance that the body tries to maintain.\n\nAnxiety and Professional Burnout\n\nSoftware engineers are often under pressure to solve complex problems and meet rigorous deadlines (this is a controversial point that I need to write another blog post about, in many moments we have the possibility of saying no, but we can't or are afraid to say it), which can already lead them to high levels of stress. When the idea of leaving the comfort zone and embracing novelty is added to this load, it can result in overwhelming anxiety or even professional burnout.\n\nAnxiety and Professional Burnout as Key Factors in the Comfort Zone (in Spanish), the article explores how ~~anxiety~~ (crossed out because we need to learn to deal with our anxieties) and professional burnout can be key factors that keep people in their comfort zone.\n\nSocial and Structural Expectations\n\nTechnology work environments are often highly structured with clear expectations. This can make software engineers stuck in certain norms and routines, making it more challenging to step out of the comfort zone. In addition, the need to keep up-to-date with rapidly changing technological innovations can sometimes cause them to opt for technologies with which they are already familiar to meet time and productivity demands.\n\nComfort Zone as a Social Construct (in Spanish), the article explores how the comfort zone is a social construct that can be shaped by societal expectations and norms.\n\n---\n\nSeveral factors collaborate to keep software engineers within their comfort zones. Recognizing and understanding these elements may be the first step to overcoming the barriers to personal and professional growth.\n\nIt is necessary to know oneself and ask difficult questions, such as:\n\n What am I avoiding?\n If it goes wrong, what can I do to recover?\n What can I do to feel safer when stepping out of the comfort zone?\n\n> note: if it goes wrong*, you can go back to where you came from, but with a wealth of knowledge and experience that you would never have had if you had not faced your fears.",

    "content" : "While the path to the position of Chief Technology Officer (CTO) may seem similar to many, each story is uniquely extraordinary, colored by the unique combination of experiences, struggles and intensive learning. In Invisible Learning, John Seely Brown and David Thomas discuss how learning is often an invisible path, rooted not only in formalities, but also deeply woven into the fabric of our life experiences. This is my story within Buser.\n\nFrom Anonymity to Center Stage\n\nI joined Buser, not as CTO, but as a member of the software engineering team. Previously, I had been CTO at several companies and was enjoying the relative obscurity of this more reserved role, shying away from the limelight that usually accompanies the CTO function.\n\nIn one of my first one-to-one conversations with Tony Lampada - Buser's CTO at the time - he expressed his desire to return to the engineering team, sharing his dissatisfaction with the CTO position. This is a relatively common move in technology, as described by Michael Lopp in Managing Humans. In response, I referred him to three other potential candidates, emphasizing that I wasn't interested.\n\n> was enjoying my moment of anonymity and didn't want to return to center stage (the CTO is constantly in the spotlight), it's worth reading this blogpost (sorry for being in pt-BR).\n\nWhen the Unthinkable Starts to Rumble - reflection is the way\n\nDaniel Kahneman points out in Fast and Slow: Two Ways of Thinking, sometimes System 2 (our slow and thoughtful thinking), can be born out of unexpected encounters. The conversation with Tony remained etched in my mind for two months.\n\nI decided to find an answer for myself as to why the idea of becoming CTO seemed to have taken root in my consciousness. One Monday, I acknowledged my insecurity to Tony: I'm sure I'm not the best person to lead a technology team of 180 people, but if you think I can handle it and learn in a timely manner, let's talk!.\n\nContinuous Learning as CTO\n\nDespite my initial doubts, I accepted the role, aware that I had a lot to learn. Inspired by Carol Dweck in Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, adopting a growth mindset is crucial. I recognize that I'm not the best, I'm still on a journey of constant learning and improvement.\n\nI admire the talents we have at Buser, some of the best engineers I've ever met (new professionals, but with the will to make it happen, with a great thirst for learning) and I remain convinced that each new company represents a new flight. Bruce Mau emphasizes in Massive Limit, to use previous knowledge as a basis, but never assume it as absolute truth. A previous history as a CTO does not equate to a perfect transition to the next one - it requires careful adaptation to the new environment*.\n\nIn short, my history in the technology hierarchies is a mosaic of reflections, uncertainties, learnings and adaptations. To all aspiring tech leaders, the advice is: be open to unforeseen challenges, welcome constant learning and the humility to adapt and mold to the ever-changing landscape. A brilliant, perplexed and eager-to-learn spirit is the true engine of growth.\n\nOf course I was ~~afraid~~ (created by my mental monsters), the difference was that I transformed the fear into energy to move me forward, not to block me/freeze me.\n\n> if it doesn't scare you, it's not big enough",

    "content" : "Change is a constant in my life, and I accept each one with a resilient countenance and an open heart. The discomfort generated by each transformation is not an enemy, but a stimulus that I use to improve my environment and who I am on the inside.\n\nIf a change doesn't produce the expected results, instead of giving in to discouragement, I return to where I started. I treat each failure as a learning opportunity, a challenge to improve my understanding and adapt my next agenda for change.\n\nIn general, there are three types of person when we talk about change:\n\n1. Those who are afraid of change: These individuals feel paralyzed when faced with a new situation. The fear of the unknown freezes their steps, preventing them from leaving their current position;\n2. Those who avoid change: These people can manage change, but prefer to avoid it as much as possible. Change is only seen as a last resort;\n3. Change addicts: This third type - my type - is the one who takes change naturally. We feel a certain enthusiasm in the face of the unknown, and we love the chill in the belly caused by the expectation of the new.\n\nI certainly fall into the category of change addicts.\n\nIn the book The Courage to Be Imperfect by Brené Brown, there's a quote that I love: Vulnerability is not knowing how to control or predict. It's the ability to breathe through our insecurity and make it happen anyway. This reflects what it's like to be a person addicted to change: we face the unknown, accept our vulnerability and make the magic happen.\n\nIt's amazing how much we can grow when we embrace change. So challenge yourself, get out of your comfort zone and see how surprising life can be.\n\nVulnerability can be a real catalyst for personal growth and authenticity. When we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, we create space to embrace our uncertainties and face our deepest fears. By exposing ourselves in this way, we demonstrate courage and authenticity, strengthening our human connections and encouraging mutual respect and empathy. In addition, vulnerability puts us in a state of openness that is conducive to learning, evolution and innovation. Therefore, being vulnerable is not a weakness, but a strength that can be harnessed to become better versions of ourselves.",

    "content" : "In the digital age we live in today, technology plays an essential role in all industries. Companies that use technology as a key part of their business strategy are at a competitive advantage, driving innovation and achieving success at a rapid pace. These companies are called tech-enabled companies.\n\nWhat is a tech-enabled company?\n\nA tech-enabled company is one that incorporates technology into its _DNA_. It recognizes the importance of adapting and leveraging technological solutions to optimize its internal operations, boost efficiency and improve the customer experience. Technology is not just a support for these companies, but a central element of their business strategy.\n\nThe difference between a tech-enabled company and a technology company lies in its focus and core business nature. A tech-enabled company incorporates technology into its operations and strategies to improve efficiency, process automation and the customer experience. Technology is a support or enabler for achieving its business objectives. On the other hand, a technology company _(or tech company)_ has technology as its main product or service. It develops and offers innovative technological solutions, such as software, hardware, applications or platforms, which are the essential elements of its business model. In short, while a tech-enabled company uses technology to enhance its business, a technology company has its essence and value proposition based on the creation and supply of technological products or services.\n\nAdvantages of tech-enabled companies\n\nTech-enabled companies enjoy several competitive advantages. By adopting advanced technological solutions, they can:\n\n1. Automate tasks and processes: Technology enables the automation of repetitive tasks, which increases productivity and frees up resources for more strategic activities;\n2. Scalability: With the right technology, companies can easily scale their business to meet growing demand, without compromising quality or efficiency;\n3. Agility and adaptation: Tech-enabled companies are able to quickly adapt to changes in market demands and emerging trends, seizing growth opportunities and overcoming challenges;\n4. Innovation: Technology is a catalyst for innovation. Tech-enabled companies are constantly exploring new solutions and ideas to improve their products, services and processes.\n\nExamples of successful tech-enabled companies\n\nSeveral companies stand out as examples of success in the tech-enabled world. Here are four of them:\n\n Buser: revolutionized the travel sector by employing a digital platform to connect travelers to road transport companies. Just like _Airbnb and Uber_, using technology to offer a more affordable, convenient and personalized experience to its users;\n Airbnb: revolutionized the hospitality industry by using a digital platform to connect people who want to rent spaces with those who have accommodations available. Technology enabled Airbnb to scale globally and create a more convenient and personalized experience for travelers;\n Uber: combining mobile technology, geolocation and electronic payments, Uber transformed the transportation industry. Its platform connects passengers to drivers, providing a more affordable, convenient and flexible service than traditional taxis;\n Amazon: started as an online bookstore and became an e-commerce giant. The company invested heavily in technology to automate and optimize its supply chain, improve the customer experience and offer a variety of products at competitive prices.\n\nNot only tech lives the success of startups\n\nAlthough tech-enabled companies have expanded their possibilities for growth and innovation, it is important to highlight that not all startups need to be _technology companies to succeed_. Sectors such as food, health and services also offer significant opportunities for startups that offer innovative and differentiated solutions.\n\nStartups in the food sector can focus on sustainable ingredients or the delivery of healthy, ready-to-eat meals. In the health area, startups can develop technologies focused on well-being and remote monitoring. In the services sector, they can create digital platforms that facilitate on-demand services.\n\nThe success of a startup does not depend only on its classification as a technology company, but on its ability to identify problems in the market and provide effective and innovative solutions.\n\n> Although tech-enabled companies have their advantages, other startups _(and/or companies)_ also have room to shine, the important thing is to find the right combination of innovation and value proposition for the target market\n\n==Do you work for a tech-enabled company or a tech company?==",

    "content" : "The concept of talent density is a pivotal factor in the sustainable growth and long-term success of any business. It’s a strategy that has been championed by leading companies like Netflix and has become a cornerstone of their corporate culture. Talent density refers to the concentration of high-performing individuals within an organization. It’s not just about having a few star players, but rather ensuring that every team member is a key contributor to the company’s success.\n\nThere are several stages of a company, each stage requires people/teams with different characteristics.\nI have no doubt that talent density is the best way to grow sustainably.\n\n> I understand companies that are in the moment of accelerated growth and have large teams to “deliver faster”, but one day this law arrives and leads managers to make difficult decisions thinking about what is best for the company.\n\nImplementing Talent Density in Your Company\n\n1. Selective Hiring: Avoid rushing the hiring process. Take the time to find individuals who not only have the necessary skills, but also align with the company’s values and culture;\n2. Performance Recognition: Acknowledge and reward employees who add value. This not only motivates high performers but also sets a benchmark for success within the team;\n3. Cultural Fit and Swift Action: Act quickly to address employees who do not fit the company culture or meet performance standards. This maintains the integrity of the team and ensures that the company’s values are upheld.\n\nI think 3 is essential, it makes item 2 clear to all employees.\n\nthis text came about after reading the text below.\n\n---\n\noriginal publication by Yinon Ravid\n\nPay more, hire less. A counterintuitive hiring principle: you save money when you pay people more. In early 2022, we changed how we hire at Albert. Here’s how we did it: <https://fnd.news/40iJYow>\n\nBecause the productivity of an A player is exponentially higher than a B player, hiring B players means that you need ten times as many people to do each task. This leads to a bloated, slow moving, bureaucratic organization.\n\nAs you hire more B players, costs grow quickly because you need a lot of them, leading to long-term unprofitability. Worse, mediocre talent builds brittle systems that create ongoing fire drills, inevitably on nights and weekends. This ruins morale. In contrast, when you hire exceptional people, things get built quickly, systems run smoothly, and morale is high.\n\nTotal costs go down when you hire the best people and pay them very well.\n\nIn early 2022, we changed our approach at Albert. We decided to hire fewer people, focus on exceptional hires, and pay in the top 5th percentile of our competitors for leadership positions.\n\nThis transformed our organization. We increased productivity and lowered overall costs.\n\nTo find great people at a startup, I follow the 5 principles below, which took me a decade to understand.\n\n1. Clear thinkers only. Find people who can explain what they do to a novice.\n2. No big company people. Big company folks are uncomfortable with how much you have to do on your own at a startup. I’ve never seen this work.\n3. Take your time. Only hire people who you are near-certain will be exceptional. This is very hard to stick to. Missing on a B+ candidate is a good thing.\n4. Find people who prefer ambiguity. Project specs change multiple times for all projects at startups.\n5. Challenge + discomfort = growth. Find people who embrace this principle and are willing to challenge themselves beyond comfort. Employees must grow for a company to grow.\n\nImportantly, anyone can become exceptional.

It’s not just about language proficiency; it’s about bridging gaps, fostering collaboration, and amplifying the impact of open source projects on a global scale.\n\nThe Journey to Global Connection\n\nIt’s often said that taking the first step is the hardest. For many, including myself, the decision to write in English was a calculated one, influenced by the desire to connect with a broader audience and the recognition of English as a common language in the tech world. This step, although seemingly daunting, is crucial for one’s professional trajectory.\n\n> Embracing a world-class mindset means sometimes being _“selfish”_ with our careers, prioritizing growth and global reach.\n\nThe Essence of Writing in English\n\nWhy the emphasis on English? The answer lies in the heart of the open source community. Writing in English allows for a deeper connection with those who maintain, contribute, and benefit from free open source software (FOSS). Since my early days in 2008, I’ve been an active contributor to various open source projects. By 2015, I found myself maintaining projects that thousands rely on.\n\n> A quick glance at my GitHub account (@avelino) reveals a story of dedication and passion for open source contributions.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nChange is the only constant. While the medium of communication might shift to English, the essence remains unchanged.

    "content" : "A cultura organizacional é o conjunto de valores, crenças e comportamentos compartilhados pelos membros de uma organização. Ela é criada ao longo do tempo (mesmo muitas pessoas dizendo que a cultura é encontrada não criada) e é moldada por uma variedade de fatores, incluindo a história da organização, sua missão, seus valores e suas lideranças.\n\nUma cultura forte pode ser um ativo valioso para a organização. Ela pode ajudar a atrair e reter os melhores talentos, principalmente ~~expurgar~~ as pessoas que não tem aderencia com a cultura, possívelmente aumentar a produtividade e melhorar a satisfação dos clientes. \n\n> Se você deseja construir uma empresa de sucesso, é importante ter uma cultura forte.\n\nComo criar uma cultura organizacional _forte_:\n\n Defina seus valores: o que é importante para sua empresa? Quais são seus valores fundamentais? Uma vez que você tenha uma boa compreensão de seus valores, você pode começar a criar uma cultura que os reflita.\n Comunique sua cultura: certifique-se de que todos colaboradores tenha em mente os valores da empresa e como você espera que eles se comportem. Você pode fazer isso através de treinamentos, campanhas de comunicação interna e outros canais.\n Recompense comportamentos consistentes com a cultura: quando os colaboradores se comportam de maneiras consistentes com a cultura, certifique-se de recompensá-los. Isso os ajudará a entender que você valoriza esses comportamentos e que você espera que eles continuem fazendo.\n Cumpra suas promessas: se você promete algo aos colaboradores, simplismente cumpra. Isso ajudará a construir confiança e credibilidade, o que é essencial para uma cultura forte.\n Seja consistente: a cultura leva tempo para ser construída. Não espere resultados da noite para o dia. Seja paciente e consistente, e você eventualmente verá uma cultura forte se desenvolvendo em sua empresa.\n\nComo alinhar a cultura criada com a liderança\n\nOs lideres tem como responsabilidade de alinhar à cultura organizacional com a estratégia. Eles devem garantir que a estratégia não vá contra os valores, a missão e a visão da empresa, principalmente garantir que a cultura esteja conhectado com os objetivos e metas da empresa.\n\nAlinhar a cultura com a estratégia:\n\n Compreender os valores, a missão e a visão da empresa.\n Compreender os objetivos e metas da empresa.\n Identificar os comportamentos que estão alinhados com a cultura.\n Recompensar os comportamentos que estão alinhados com a cultura.\n Disciplinar os comportamentos que não estão alinhados com a cultura.\n\nComo sustentar a cultura da empresa (evitar a cultura se perder)\n\nA cultura de uma empresa pode se perder ao longo do tempo, se não forem tomadas medidas para sustentá-la. Os diretores são os responsáveis por sustentar a cultura da empresa. Eles devem garantir que a cultura seja continuamente reforçada e atualizada.\n\nPara sustentar a cultura, os diretores devem:\n\n Comunicar os valores, a missão e a visão da empresa de forma contínua.\n Treinar os colaboradores sobre os valores, a missão e a visão da empresa de forma contínua.\n Criar um ambiente de trabalho que seja consistente com os valores da empresa de forma contínua.\n Reconhecer e recompensar os colaboradores que estão alinhados com a cultura de forma contínua.\n Fazer uma avaliação regular da cultura da empresa e tomar medidas para melhorá-la.\n\nSe os diretores seguirem essas dicas, eles podem criar uma cultura de empresa forte que ajudará a empresa a alcançar seus objetivos e metas.\n\nNunca será fácil manter cultura, tenha como base os pilares contratar, promover e demitir:\n\n Contrate pessoas que se encaixem com a cultura: quando você está contratando novos colaboradores, não se esqueça de avaliar sua cultura. As pessoas que se encaixam na cultura são mais propensas a ser felizes e produtivas no trabalho.\n Promova pessoas que estão alinhadas com a cultura: quando você está promovendo colaboradores, certifique-se de escolher pessoas que estão alinhadas com a cultura da empresa. Essas pessoas são mais propensas a contribuir para o sucesso da empresa.\n Demita pessoas que não estão alinhadas com a cultura: se um colaboradores não estiver alinhado com a cultura da empresa, é melhor demiti-lo. Isso ajudará a proteger a cultura da empresa e a garantir que ela seja mantida forte.\n\nFalar sobre desligar pessoas não é muito amigavel - já muitos líderes ter dificuldade de desligar pessoas que não estão aderente com o momento da empresa.",

    "content" : "> Contra fatos (resultado) não há argumentos, essa é muito utilizada, mas não é simples aplicar no dia-a-dia.\n\nO storytelling é uma forma poderosa de comunicar idéias e gerar conexão com seu público. Ao contar uma história com dados reais, você compartilhar seus conhecimentos, experiências e perspectivas de uma forma que seja memorável.\n\nOs resultados são fatos e estatísticas que apoiam sua história e ajudam a torná-la mais credível e convincente.\n\nPor exemplo, se você estiver contando uma história sobre os benefícios de um novo produto, inclua resultados de pesquisas que demonstram como o produto melhorou a vida dos clientes.\n\nOs resultados devem ser usados em qualquer tipo de história, seja ela uma história pessoal ou uma história de negócios. Ao usar resultados, você pode tornar seu storytelling mais envolvente e convincente, e você pode ajudar seu público a entender melhor sua mensagem.\n\nSeguem algumas dicas que utilizo para conectar resultado com storytelling:\n\n Entenda qual seu público, conecte o resultado de forma fácil para o público entender.\n Use resultados relevantes para sua história. Certifique-se de que os resultados que você usa sejam diretamente relacionados à mensagem que você está tentando transmitir.\n Use resultados claros e concisos. Evite usar jargões ou termos técnicos que seu público possa não entender.\n Use resultados para apoiar sua história, não para substituí-la. Os resultados devem ser usados para complementar sua história e ajudá-la a ter um impacto maior no seu público.\n\nO storytelling com base em resultados faz muito mais sentido do que história por história. Isso ocorre porque os resultados fornecem provas concretas que apoiam suas afirmações. Quando você pode fornecer resultados para apoiar suas histórias, você está construindo confiança com seu público. Eles veem que você é um profissional que sabe o que está falando, e eles estão mais propensos a acreditar em você e confiar em você.\n\nPortanto, se você deseja contar histórias que sejam envolventes e convincentes, certifique-se de usar resultados para apoiar suas histórias. Os resultados ajudarão você a construir confiança com seu público e a tornar sua mensagem mais poderosa.\n\nBusque resultado, não história\n\nSe focar no resultado, a história será memorável. Infelizmente, se só pensar na história, o resultado tende a ser medíocre.\n\nIsso ocorre porque ao se concentrar no resultado, está pensando onde quer chegar, não em distração que levará para longe dele. Ao pensar em como quer contar a história, tende deixar o ego lhe afastar do objetivo (resultado).\n\nAo se concentrar apenas na história, está propenso contar uma que seja chata, previsível e sem impacto. Isso ocorre porque está focado em contar uma história que seja ~~boa~~ do que compartilhar o resultado em forma de história (relevante para seu público).\n\nEntão, se quer contar histórias que sejam memoráveis, concentre-se no resultado. Pense no que deseja que seu público aprenda. E compartilhe um bom resultado em forma de história relevante para eles.\n\nTechGuide: Storytelling com dados\n\nNesta conversa, o @Paulo Silveira (host que é um contador de histórias), @Valquíria Alencar (Instrutora de Dados na Alura) e @Guilherme Silveira (CINO da Alura) falou sobre Ciência de Dados e storytelling, a capacidade de contar uma história ou passar adiante uma informação clara e interessante quando estamos criando exibições de análises de dados.\n\n<iframe title=TechGuide: Storytelling com dados – Hipsters Ponto Tech #368 src=https://pca.st/embed/znhga6y3 style=border: 0; border-radius: 8px; width: 100% frameborder=0></iframe>",

    "content" : "Um aspecto crucial do autoaperfeiçoamento é atingir o equilíbrio certo entre confiança e humildade, especialmente em nossa comunicação com as outras pessoas.\n\nDevemos sempre ouvir atentamente os outros porque eles podem nos dar o conhecimento que nos falta às vezes e nos ajudar a corrigir alguns erros que estamos cometendo inconscientemente\n\nConfiança: chave de ouro para uma comunicação clara\n\nA confiança tem um papel fundamental no compartilhamento de ideias, opiniões e conhecimentos. Quando falamos com convicção, é provável que consigamos atrair a atenção das pessoas e gerar impacto duradouro. Porem, a confiança nunca deve ser confundida com arrogância ou mente fechada. É extremamente importante reconhecer que nosso conhecimento, embora valioso, não é infalível.\n\nHumildade: porta de entrada para o aprendizado e o crescimento\n\nEmbora a confiança seja necessária para ter comunicação clara, a humildade é a chave para o aprendizado e o crescimento contínuos. Adotar atitude de humildade significa reconhecer que sempre há mais a aprender e que outras pessoas podem ter percepções que podem ampliar nosso entendimento. Ouvir ativamente (ter escuta ativa) e estar aberto a novas ideias, criamos oportunidades de crescimento pessoal e autoaperfeiçoamento.\n\n> Fale como se estivesse certo, ouça como se estivesse errado\n\nA frase cima resume o delicado equilíbrio entre confiança e humildade na comunicação.\nFalar com convicção permite expressar nossas ideias de forma eficaz, por outro lado, estar em uma conversa com a escuta ativa facilita o aprendizado. Mantendo esse equilíbrio, participamos de um diálogo significativo, desafiar nossas suposições e promover o crescimento pessoal e profissional.\n\nEscuta ativa: arte de obter conhecimento das outras pessoas\n\nEscuta ativa é um componente essencial para uma comunicação eficaz e principalmente do crescimento pessoal. Ao prestar atenção genuinamente nas pessoas, descobriremos novos ponto de vista, identificar brechas (falhas, pontos a melhorar) em nosso conhecimento e evoluir nossa forma de pensar. Promovendo cultura de escuta ativa, podemos criar um ambiente que as ideias e opiniões de todos são valorizadas, que provavelmente nos levará a melhor tomada de decisão, trazendo as pessoas junto (senso mais forte de comunidade).\n\nA estratégia deve ser equilibrar confiança e humildade.\n\nAlgumas estratégias práticas para dominar a arte de confiança e humildade (de forma equilibrada):\n\n Pratique a escuta ativa: busque entender a perspectiva da pessoa que esta falando e faça perguntas esclarecedoras para entender o ponto de vista dele, isso demonstrará seu envolvimento;\n Tenha mentalidade de crescimento: reconheça que seu conhecimento e suas habilidades não são fixos e podem ser desenvolvidos por meio de esforço e aprendizado;\n Busque feedback: solicite regularmente feedback de outras pessoas para descobrir pontos cegos em sua compreensão e identificar áreas para aprimoramento;\n Reflita sobre seus próprios pré-conceitos e preconceitos: esteja ciente de seus próprios preconceitos e suposições, esteja disposto a quebrá-los com novas informações.",

Passamos boa parte do nosso tempo no trabalho ou pensando no trabalho, é crucial reconhecê-lo como trabalho e ele não deve ser o único fator em nossa vida.\n\n> O trabalho é apenas uma peça do quebra-cabeça\n\n_Embora o sucesso profissional e a segurança financeira sejam super importantes_, é extremamente importante não deixar que o trabalho se torne o superconjunto que domina e ofusca as outras partes da nossa vida. Colocando o foco apenas no trabalho, podemos negligenciar outras áreas críticas que contribuem para uma vida plena, como saúde, familia, relacionamentos, e crescimento pessoal (não necessariamente profissional).\n\nLembre-se que o trabalho é um meio para atingir um fim, ~~não o fim em si~~.

Reserve um tempo dedicado a conectar e nutrir esses laços, pois eles proporcionam um sistema vital de apoio e equilíbrio emocional.\n- Invista em sua saúde: faça esforço consciente para priorizar seu bem-estar físico, mental e emocional. Exercite-se regularmente, coma saudavelmente, pratique técnicas de redução do estresse e procure ajuda profissional quando necessário.\n- Busque interesses pessoais: reserve tempo para passatempos e interesses fora do trabalho. Envolver-se em atividades pelas quais você é apaixonado pode levar ao aumento da felicidade, à redução do estresse e a uma maior sensação de realização.\n- Estabeleça Fronteiras: estabeleça limites claros entre o trabalho e a vida pessoal. Evite trabalhar horas excessivamente longas ou trazer trabalho para casa. Ao estabelecer limites, você pode proteger seu tempo e energia para outros aspectos essenciais da vida.\n- Abrace a aprendizagem ao longo da vida: continue aprendendo e crescendo, tanto pessoal quanto profissionalmente. Busque novas experiências, adquira novas habilidades e desafie-se a ser a melhor versão de si mesmo.\n- Reflita e Reavalie: reflita e reavalie regularmente sobre sua vida e avalie se você está mantendo um equilíbrio saudável. Ajuste suas prioridades e compromissos de acordo para garantir que você esteja vivendo em alinhamento com seus valores e aspirações.\n\nSe for adequado para você, não deixe que o trabalho domine todo o quadro; ao invés disso, procure criar uma vida bem balanceada e equilibrada que englobe todos os diferentes aspectos que trazem sentido e realização à sua existência.",

    "content" : "Antes de falar sobre como criar cultura de engenharia de produto precisamos alinhar o que é Engenharia de Produto (para pessoa engenheira de software) e principalmente o que é cultura (ou pelo menos o que estou chamando de cultura).\nEngenharia de Produto é um processo que colocamos nosso usuário como protagonista do produto que estamos desenvolvendo e buscamos entender os pontos com maior fricção para priorizar o que precisa ser feito (não só o que queremos). Geralmente pessoas engenheiras de produto são apaixonadas em usar tecnologia para resolver problemas e sabe como aplica-la para solucionar problema a curto, médio e longo prazo, começando de forma simples (também podemos chamar de MVP) e conectada com a estratégia de longo prazo. Leia mais aqui.\nCultura é o conjunto de saberes, costumes, tradições e expressões transmitidas de geração em geração por um grupo de pessoas, à forma como essas pessoas encaram o mundo e interagem entre si.\n\nO que é Cultura de Engenharia de Produto\n\nÉ uma abordagem para desenvolver produtos de alta qualidade e rentáveis, envolvendo as melhores práticas da engenharia, a criatividade e a colaboração. Esta cultura se concentra em obter maior lucratividade e sucesso dos produtos na vida útil. Isso inclui o uso de análise de desempenho, análises de risco, pesquisa de mercado e processos de design para criar produtos que atendam às necessidades dos clientes. Também incentiva a inovação, a busca de excelência e uma mentalidade de longo prazo.\nVisando garantir o sucesso do produto, a cultura incentiva a colaboração entre as pessoas envolvidas no processo. Por exemplo, pessoas engenheiras trabalhar próximo de pessoas de marketing, comercial e etc, com o propósito de desenvolver um produto para atender melhor às necessidades dos clientes. Essa colaboração é essencial para o sucesso do produto e para assegurar que o produto está evoluindo com a necessidade dos clientes e não por ~~achismo~~ dos gestores.\nA cultura de engenharia de produto também trabalha com um escopo mais amplo de perspectivas de negócios. Por exemplo, levamos em conta a manutenção e o processo de atualização do produto, além do custo em que o produto foi produzido e o retorno sobre o investimento. Ao usar esses recursos para obter informações sobre como melhorar o desempenho dos produtos, os profissionais de engenharia de produto podem criar soluções eficientes e lucrativas para qualquer problema.\nO aspecto chave de uma cultura de engenharia de produto é o foco na colaboração e comunicação. Isto envolve reuniões regulares e check-ins para assegurar que todos os membros da equipe estejam na mesma página, bem como a utilização de ferramentas e tecnologias para facilitar a colaboração e comunicação (independente da localização de cada membro do time) - sem sombra de dúvida as metodologias ágeis ajudarão muito e garantirá a recorrência da comunicação.\nEm resumo, uma cultura de engenharia de produto é caracterizada por um foco na entrega de produtos de alta qualidade que satisfaçam as necessidades dos clientes, bem como um compromisso de colaboração, comunicação, e melhoria contínua. Ao promover este tipo de cultura, as organizações podem criar um ambiente de trabalho positivo e produtivo que permita a máxima inovação e sucesso.\n\nComo criar uma Cultura de Engenharia de Produto?\n\nIndependente da cultura que você quer ou precisa criar é um processo árduo, contínuo e leva tempo - cultura não será criada do dia para noite - quando você cansar de falar sobre a cultura será o momento que as pessoas estão começando entender o primeiro item da cultura, isso significa que a liderança deve constantemente investir muito tempo para falar sobre cultura e formar novos guardiões da cultura.\nA chave para o sucesso da criação de cultura é o diálogo contínuo, o envolvimento das pessoas no processo e consistência na prática. Descrevo abaixo como tenho feito para construir essa cultura na Buser:\n\n Desenvolva software coletando métricas dos seus usuários. É comum ter ansiedade (pressa) para colocar um novo recurso do produto no ar, mas não caia na armadilha de colocar o recurso em produção sem antes coletar métricas úteis de uso do novo recurso. Tendo métricas conseguimos priorizar a evolução do recurso ou até mesmo descontinuar o recurso.\n Busque sempre conhecer seu usuário. Quanto mais você conhecer seu cliente melhor é (tenha empatia), entrevistas, discoveries e etc são primordiais para se conectar com ele - é comum pessoas que não conhece produto não gostar de discovery por ter tido experiencia com discovery que levam dias e dias, não crie pré-conceito com suas experiências ruim antes de estudar sobre discovery.\n Conheça os dados que esta capturando. Você deve ser a pessoa que mais conhece os dados que esta capturando do seu cliente (mesmo que seja um simples click no botão XYZ).\n Busque usar dados como seu guia. Ser data drive não é nada fácil (principalmente para quem está começando), então comece usando os dados como validador do seufeeling, mas busque ter dados confiáveis, assim conseguira deixar o feeling de lado e usar verdadeiramente os dados.\n Invista muito tempo em melhorar a comunicação. Ter uma comunicação clara e concisa não é fácil - o maior problema das empresas são GAPs de comunicação. Se o time todo não estiver indo pro mesmo lado faremos um cabo de guerra, gastando energia com assuntos desnecessários.\n Conecte as pessoas engenheiras com o negócio. Seremos melhores pessoas engenheiras quando conseguirmos entender o negócio da empresa. Estimule e dê tempo para seu time de engenharia entender sobre o negócio, se possível incentive eles a se tornar usuário do produto que desenvolve.\n Entenda todos os custos envolvidos. Tenha controle do custo que seu produto gera, assim você conseguirá estimar quanto o novo recurso custará e entender se vale o investimento. Exemplo: o custo do time éde R$ 100 mil/mês, o novo recurso vai agregar R$ 10 mil/mês, você precisa de 10 meses de faturamento (depois que o novo recurso entrou no ar) para recuperar o investimento. Não estou falando para não arriscar no desenvolvimento desse recurso e sim entender se não tem outro recurso que pode ter mais ROI (retorno sobre investimento).\n Esteja aberto para feedback. A melhor maneira de melhorar a cultura é ouvindo as pessoas que vão viver ela no dia a dia. Peça o feedback deles sobre tudo, incentivando a colaboração e o diálogo aberto - isso fará as pessoas se sentir parte da definição da cultura, assim formando fiéis guardiões.\n Desenvolva e incentive a liderança. Identifique bons líderes entre os seus colaboradores, estimule-os e treine-os para replicar uma cultura saudável.\n Crie oportunidades para a colaboração. Crie oportunidades para que as pessoas trabalhem juntas em projetos* interessantes - estimular a colaboração cria um ambiente de trabalho produtivo e de sucesso.",

    "content" : "A cada dia que passa é mais comum as empresas querer puxar as pessoas desenvolvedoras para área de negócio, por outro lado, as pessoas desenvolvedoras não querem ir para área de negócio.\n\nAcho meio logico o porquê as pessoas desenvolvedoras não querem ir para área de negócio, ela estudou (esta estudando) alguma área relacionada com computação, se ela de fato quisesse ir para área de “negocio” provavelmente ela não teria feito computação.\n\nSerá que nós pessoas desenvolvedoras não devemos pensar um pouco mais como engenheiro de produto ao invés de só dizer que não quer ir para área de negócio?\n\nO que é engenharia de produto?\n\nComparado a um engenheiro de software, a pessoa Engenheira de Produto é alguém que acredita que seu tempo é melhor utilizado para entender as necessidades dos clientes e trabalhar para construir as melhores soluções para atender os clientes.\n\nEm vez de colocar seus esforços apenas nos aspectos técnicos essa pessoa olha para a experiência do usuário (UX), sem deixar de lado a infra-estrutura de tecnologia. É envolvida em todo o ciclo de descoberta de produto para trazer seu olhar de tecnologia para a solução que melhor atende o usuário.\n\nA pessoa engenheira de produto busca inovação, estratégia e entusiasmo em entregar o que o usuário do produto precisa, não só o código que faz o produto se tornar realidade — código é o meio para resolver algum problema, não a entrega final para o produto.\n\nSabemos o impacto que o código gera para o negócio e usuários, mas ele não é o protagonista para o produto. Aproximando pessoas de engenharia, produto e design possivelmente chegaremos na melhor solução para o problema, sempre colocando o usuário como centro da tomada de decisão.\n\nNão basta entregar software” sem pensar como os dados gerado por ele será usado. A maioria dos produtos depende de software para gerar dados e com os dados as pessoas de negócio conseguir tomar a melhor decisão para qual caminha o produto ou empresa deve seguir.\n\n> Geralmente o engenheiro de software coloca seus esforços em entregar o software que esta desenvolvendo, pensando pouco como o software e dados serão usados.\n\nEm resumo: a pessoa engenheira de produto é alguém que busca entender o usuário e pontos com maior fricção. São apaixonados em usar tecnologia para resolver problemas e sabe como aplica-la para solucionar o problema a curto, médio e longo prazo, começando simples e conectada com a estratégia de longo prazo.\n\nTodas pessoas desenvolvedoras devem ser engenheiras de produto?\n\nNão sei responder essa pergunta, mas acredito que todas as pessoas desenvolvedoras deveriam entender porque está recebendo seu salário, geralmente não é só para escrever qualquer código e sim transformar problema em solução que agregue mais valor para o negócio da empresa em formato de código.\n\n> Seremos melhores pessoas engenheiras quando conseguirmos entender o negócio da empresa.\n\nPara responder essa pergunta para mim, fui à teoria como um time de alta performance é formado.\n\nEquipe de alta performance pode ser definida como um grupo de pessoas que possuem talentos e competência que se complementam, que estão alinhados e comprometidos com um objetivo em comum, demonstra um alto nível de colaboração e inovação, assim resultando em ações com qualidade. Sempre unida e focada em seu objetivo, pronta para suportar algum membro que esteja enfrentando alguma dificuldade ou barreira e para assim garantir que irá atingir o objetivo.\n\nÉ uma equipe em que as pessoas têm um altíssimo grau comprometimento com o resultado de alto nível. Por isso, que os membros do time possuem a colaboração como uma característica para resolução de problemas.\n\nEquilíbrio entre Qualidade e Entrega\n\nO CEO (Chief Executive Officer) quer mais clientes, CTO (Chief Technology Officer) quer um excelente software, CPO (Chief Product Officer) busca resolver ambos assuntos usando esse conhecimento e experiência aplicada no produto, com dados, metodologia e métodos.\n\nO engenheiro de produto usa sua experiência técnica para trabalhar com a equipe de desenvolvimento, priorizando o que precisa ser feito contra o que pode ser feito, metrificando tempo investido e retorno para o produto.\n\nO centro da priorização deve ser os dados de uso do produto, buscando entregar o que o cliente precisa e menos o que “achamos” que ele precisa. Para determinar esse valor, devemos conseguir usar a tecnologia para criar protótipos dos novos recursos, descobrir como eles se encaixam na experiência do usuário e entender como eles impactam o produto atual.\n\nUsando a tecnologia para criar laços de feedback, priorizando o que deve ser construído no próximo ciclo, interpretando o resultado dos dados coletados contra o que seu conhecimento previu de mercado, levando isso de volta ao time de desenvolvimento e recomeçando o ciclo novamente.",

    "content" : "A demanda por tempo de um gerente são infinitas e às vezes parece que você é demandado por todas as direções ao mesmo tempo. Provavelmente isso dificulta o foco e habilidade de ter visibilidade dos problemas futuros. Nesse blogpost conversaremos como limitar as pessoas exigirem mais do seu tempo e provavelmente fazer mais com menos.\n\nContextualizando\n\nUma das primeiras coisas que aprendi como gerente foi que se eu não reservar um horário na minha agenda para almoço, provavelmente não almoçaria naquele dia. Quando era engenheiro eu pensava que sabia o que significava ter muitas reuniões, mas minha promoção trouxe muitas pessoas querendo falar comigo e elas raramente pensavam se eu já teria almoçado ou não — as pessoas querem resolver os seus problemas e reunião é uma forma delas resolver, cuidar da nossa saúde deve ser nossa responsabilidade não de outras pessoas.\n\nAlguns meses depois, aprendi um pouco mais sobre minha agenda. Estava viajando a trabalho em outro fuso horário diferente (2 horas à frente da minha equipe). Para o trabalho não ocupar meu horário de jantar (as refeições são muito importante para mim), reservei no calendário qualquer reunião depois das 3pm (5pm no fuso horário da minha equipe). Como não tinha pessoa trabalhando as 7am, trabalhava média de 6 horas por dia, percebi que no final da semana tinha sido mais produtivo, mesmo estando disponível por menos horas.\n\nAssim que voltei de viagem configurei o meu calendário para mostrar meu horário de trabalho das 10am às 4pm.\n\nDemorei um pouco para entender realmente o que aconteceu e por que estava funcionando. O que começou a me ajudar a montá-la foi essa thread no twitter:\n\n\nCalendário como quadro Kanban\n\nKanban é um framework de manufatura enxuta desenvolvido na Toyota e adotado entusiasticamente pela indústria de desenvolvimento de software. O framework me agrada bastante, e descobri ter funcionado bem para mim no passado. Ele divide os fluxos de trabalho em etapas e limita o número de itens que podem se acumular em uma única etapa.\n\nO fluxos de trabalho geralmente se assemelham a algo assim:\n\n\n\nEsse board parece com o quadro quem gerencio na minha vida:\n\n\n\nTrabalho paralelo é assombroso. Ao invés de etapas de fluxo de trabalho, uso dias da semana e limite arbitrário de itens, tenho a restrição física de número de horas em um dia. Usando blocos de foco e horas de trabalho para limitar os intervalos disponíveis de 30 minutos no meu calendário, dessa forma consigo limitar o potencial trabalho em andamento (WIP), geralmente conhecido como tempo de reunião.\n\nPor que faria isso?\n\nOs benefícios são óbvios (pelo menos para mim) — menos exigências no meu tempo, menos trabalho para fazer, tudo em torno de um trabalho menos estressante, além disso, me senti mais produtivo. De onde isso vem? Minha resposta a essa pergunta veio deste fantástico tweet:\n\n\nEstou citando isso — porque é uma verdade, mas a tl;dr (longo prazo) provavelmente surgirá um imprevisto, pequenas interrupções se transformam em grandes atrasos porque não tem como recuperar o atraso.\n\n> Pense em um engarrafamento no horário de pico — a maioria dos motoristas quer dirigir a toda velocidade, mas como não há espaço entre os carros, se uma pessoa reduz a velocidade todas as outras pessoas também devem reduzir.\n\nComo faço?\n\nMeu horário de trabalho e meu horário de almoço não são absolutos — eles são flexíveis. Quando tenho que participar de uma reunião de vendas (uma necessidade consistente, mas imprevisível), é mais fácil movimentar minha agenda para participar. Quando preciso me envolver em um projeto, relatório ou qualquer evento que não consiga esperar, eu tenho espaço na minha agenda para dar atenção.\n\nIsso não seria possível se tivesse ocupado cada minuto da minha agenda. Nesse caso eu teria que repriorizar na hora, tendo que derrubar alguma reunião previamente agendada, gerando frustração nas pessoas que estava esperando a reunião ou entrega que tinha me comprometido.\n\nNesse caso o única frustração que tenho é com meu estômago, quando espero um pouco mais pelo almoço daquele dia.\n\n> Texto original publicado por Erik Wiffin",

Confesso que não entendi porque ele estava compartilhando aquilo comigo, a única resposta que me veio no momento foi:\n\n> Sé você está falando isso para eu ser CTO você está falando para a pessoa errada.\n\nAo chegar e esbarrar com os softwares que desenvolvemos na Buser comecei a pensar como o pessoal que está no programa Buser Tech (com praticamente zero experiência em desenvolvimento de software) iria conseguir subir o ambiente de desenvolvimento que eu com alguns anos de experiência em engenharia estava com algumas fricções. Encarei isso como meu primeiro desafio de reduzir a fricção do onboarding do time de engenharia trazendo um olhar de developer experience.\n\nDepois de alguns dias/semanas senti que poderíamos melhorar nossa gestão de pessoas e projetos, corri para o papai Tony e me coloquei à disposição para ajudar como Tech Manager.\n\nO assunto de possivelmente ser CTO ficou na minha mente por dias e dias, cheguei a indicar um CTO para posição que infelizmente não deu match, mas vida que segue e meus monstros internos continuaram me assombrando sobre a posição de CTO.\n\nGeralmente quando tenho frio na barriga me soa que estou olhando para um grande desafio e existe um grande desconhecido — principalmente o que preciso evoluir como pessoa e gestor, nesse caso uma empresa com mais de 500 pessoas.\n\nApós empreender por alguns anos, não quero fazer uma empresa do zero até chegar em 500 pessoas (momento atual da Buser), mas tenho certeza que o desafio de ScaleUP de uma startup me leva mais próximo do meu objetivo profissional.\n\nMesmo com frio na barriga e julgar ser uma pessoa que precisa evoluir muito estou assumindo a posição de CTO da Buser.\n\nO Tony está saindo da buser? Não, ele está voltando para próximo do time de engenharia e educação — onde ele sente que entrega muito mais resultado para a empresa.

    "content" : "O último _tempo sabático_ que tirei foi no final de 2018 quando sai do dia-a-dia da empresa que fundei em 2015, foram intensos 4 anos de trabalho e precisava parar para oxigenar meu cérebro.\n\nNo meio de 2019 resolvi voltar ao mercado de trabalho para aprender sobre como as empresas de tecnologia estão estruturando time de engenharia de software — vinha empreendendo desde 2012 até 2018 e estruturando time de engenharia como julgava ser a melhor forma, senti precisar ganhar experiencia com quem estava em momento de _scaleup_, fazendo com excelência o que eu queria aprender.\n\nEstudando sobre UX\n\nDe 2019 para cá não investi tempo para aprender assuntos diferentes que não necessariamente me dê ~dinheiro~. Em _dezembro/2021_ resolvi financiar meu aprendizado (passar alguns meses sem trabalhar e estudando) e resolvi investindo meu tempo em Experiência do Usuário (focando na _pessoa desenvolvedora_).\n\nSendo mais específico estudei sobre os seguintes assuntos:\n\n- Psicologia Cognitiva;\n- Usabilidade e Interação;\n- Interação Humano-Computador;\n- Design System;\n- e muitos outros assuntos relacionado a UX (não especifico para DevX).\n\n> Todos os temas voltado para experiência de pessoas, não necessariamente pessoa desenvolvedora.\n\nTudo que estudo profundamente coloco em prática em um ambiente publico, geralmente uso projeto Open Source para isso, sendo contribuindo com algum projeto existente ou começando um novo projeto (~caso não existe~, é muito difícil não existir um projeto open source que faça uma parte da ideia que você não teve).\n\nColocando o estudo em prática\n\nSou um dos criadores do prestd (simplifica abrir o banco de dados PostgreSQL como uma API RESTful), infelizmente subir o ambiente de produção para o prestd não era uma tarefa simples (ainda não é, mas estamos no caminho) e só de pensar em subir o ambiente para desenvolver e/ou contribuir com o projeto era ainda mais complicado — eu sentia/sinto vergonha que ajudei desenvolver um projeto com uma barreira super alta para contribuição, eu só tive essa visão após estuda sobre UX com foco em DevX. Quando tenho esse tipo de sentimento (vergonha ou algum problema) gosto de trazer os problemas para meu colo, assim tenho a oportunidade de assumir a responsabilidade de melhorar o que esta me incomodando.\n\nAlguns passos importantes que o prestd deu para simplificar a vida da pessoa desenvolvedora (que quer usar ou contribuir com o projeto):\n\n- Reestruturar a documentação com o pensamento de quem vai usar o projeto, não com pensamento de quem já conhece o projeto;\n- Limitar o número de novos recursos que entra no projeto, precisamos colocar esforços nos recursos atuais melhorando a documentação e simplificando o uso;\n- Simplificar a criação do ambiente de desenvolvimento, usando devcontainers (e sua integração com GitHub Codespace), docker-compose e permitir rodar os testes localmente (na real ele rodava localmente, mas tinha que configurar muitas coisas e até eu deixar rodar no _CI_). Escrevi aqui um blogpost falando desse processo;\n- ..., ainda temos muito que fazer/melhorar para deixar o prestd um software amigável para novas pessoas desenvolvedoras, mas sinto que estamos em uma constante evolução.\n\nQuando falamos de DevX (UX focado nas pessoas desenvolvedoras) precisamos ter empatia com as pessoas que vão usar o software que estamos desenvolvendo, e não _só_ com as pessoas que conhece o projeto, devemos nos colocar no lugar das pessoas e buscar sentir o que elas sentiriam se estivesse embarcando hoje no projeto sem ter conhecimento prévio.\n\n> O que você tem feito para deixar o software que você esta desenvolvendo atualmente mais acessível para seus usuários e novos membros do time? Lembre-se que o código é (e acredito que sempre será) um meio para chegar em algum lugar e não a linha de chegada, principalmente quando estamos falando sobre desenvolver software para outras pessoas desenvolvedoras usar - nós desenvolvedores somos pessoas que tem muito _viés cognitivo_.",

Devemos deixar esse processo o mais fluido possível para que as pessoas não desanime com a complexidade para subir o ambiente e testar, até fazer sua primeira contribuição (pull request).\n\nConfigurar o ambiente de desenvolvimento\n\nCada desenvolvedor de tem uma forma diferente de configurar ambiente de desenvolvimento, mesmo que seja em uma tecnologia (linguagem de programação) popular com muita documentação, extensões do editor de texto (emacs, vim, vscode, ...), etc.\n\nNos desenvolvedores somos acostumados com “nossa forma” de trabalhar (em geral com alguns vícios), infelizmente é comum ter resistência de mudar alguma coisa quando alguém apresentar uma forma diferente.\n\nNa grande maioria das aplicações elas depende de recursos externo como banco de dados, API, tokens e etc, se forcar o desenvolvedor (usuário) ler toda a documentação do projeto antes de ter o primeiro contato com o projeto provavelmente perderemos o engajamento dele com o projeto, gerando algumas frustrações, como:\n\n- eu só queria testar\n- tenho que ler tudo isso para ver funcionando\n- que projeto complicado\n- tenho que instalar X, Y e Z serviço/software na minha maquina\n- não conheço a linguagem de programação usada no projeto, qual plugins tenho que instalar no meu editor?\n- ... e assim por diante.\n\nExistem algumas ferramentas para auxiliar nos mantenedores de projeto (open source ou privado) para gerar um processo de bordo com o mínimo de fricção possível.\n\nDeixando automatizada a configuração do editor (com todos os plugins e parâmetros necessários), todos os serviços que o projeto necessita para funcionar, variáveis de ambiente configurada, banco de dados rodando com carga inicial de dados, visualizador de dados configurados (software para gerenciar dados do banco de dados), etc.\n\nAo ponto do desenvolvedor “clicar em um botão” e _magicamente_ estar com o ambiente de desenvolvimento pronto para testar o software.\n\nNos últimos meses nos do _prestd_ trabalhamos em melhorar nossa documentação (esta longe de ser uma boa documentação) e remover o máximo de fricção no processo de subir um novo ambiente de desenvolvimento, algumas issues que implementamos até chegar no que temos hoje:\n\n- Improve local tests execution — é frustrante alguém querer contribuir e não conseguir rodar os testes locais (usamos testes e2e, fazendo requisições para a própria API do _prestd_), foi implementado uma forma onde os testes funcionam dentro do docker usando docker-compose;\n- Documentation: new content architecture — com pensamento em uma pessoa que nunca teve contato com o _prestd_ e quer testar ou usar em ambiente de produção, ambas pessoas devem entrar na documentação e conseguir fazer o que deseja (subir o ambiente);\n- Onboarding of new contributor: using devcontainer — preparar o ambiente de desenvolvimento com _“1 click”_ usando devcontainers (suporte a GitHub Codespaces).\n\nVeja a pagina de guia de desenvolvimento do _prestd_ aqui.\n\n> Não é legal ter o time de engenharia trabalhando em um ambiente “hostil”, precisamos pensar mais em nosso time e deixar a experiência do time fluida.\n> pessoas > tecnologia\n\nFoco no desenvolvedor (usuário)\n\nO _prestd_ existe open source desde 2016, particularmente gosto muito do projeto e acredito que seja uma ótima solução para acelerar o desenvolvimento de uma API RESTful para banco de dados existente e principalmente desenvolvimento de uma nova API (projeto começando do zero).\n\nPorem durante muitos anos nos voltamos para desenvolver o software e não olhava para documentação a dedicação que deveríamos, fazendo com que a base de contribuidores fosse reduzindo (existente e novos) — pessoas passaram pelo empresa/projeto (quando estamos falando de open source o turnover é ainda maior), dificilmente ficara por muito tempo, fazendo que sempre tenhamos novos colaboradores começando no projeto.\n\nDado esse problema comentada acima, comecei olhar para documentação com mais dedicação e as decisões toda no _prestd_ daqui para frente será pensando na experiência do desenvolvedor (usuário), respondendo as seguintes perguntas:\n\n- Isso melhorará a experiência do desenvolvedor usar o projeto?\n- Isso facilitará o uso do projeto?\n- Isso facilitará manter o desenvolvimento do projeto?\n\nQuando os 3 questionamentos for “sim”, seguiremos com a implementação, independente do que seja: recurso, melhorar, correção, etc.\n\n> Versão em inglês foi publica no blog da prestd aqui.",

    "content" : "> Ao decidir sobre qual passo seguirá em sua trajetória profissional, acredito que vale pena considerar os seguintes fatores (1). Dependendo do seu momento  de pessoal e/ou profissional, diferentes fatores será mais (ou menos) importantes (2).\n\nImportante:\n\n1. Assumi-se que você achou melhor se juntar, ao invés de criar (começar uma empresa). Não estou falando de fundar ou não uma empresa, e sim desmitificar auxiliar que queira entrar em uma empresa existente e é parcial com pessoas no início da carreira.\n\n2. Algumas coisas se torna mais importantes à medida que temos filhos, ajudar membros da família ou qualquer outro ponto relacionado que seja importante para seu momento pessoal. Para algumas pessoas, o trabalho ideal é aquele que lhe dê flexibilidade de tempo, proximidade da família ou outros fatores, esses fatores podem ser cruciais para a vida e felicidade pessoal, minha intenção não é subestimá-los. Por exemplo: se você quiser estar próximo de um parente doente, alguns pontos abaixo podem se tornar inviáveis.\n\n\n\nNetwork - rede de relacionamento\n\nConsidero esse item o mais importante em nosso relacionamento pessoal e profissional. Quando falamos de network estou falando das pessoas que trabalhamos e nos relacionamos em nosso dia-a-dia.\n\nDepois de um certo nível profissional é comum, pessoas trabalharem juntos em diversas empresas (entrar em uma nova empresa e com o tempo fazer proposta outros membros do ex-time). Se você tiver boas entregas e se juntar as pessoas certas, você terá mais oportunidades ao decorrer da sua vida profissional.\n\nEx: fazer parte da rede de relacionamento dos fundadores do PayPal vai expor você a empresas como LinkedIn, Yelp, Tesla, SpaceX, Facebook e muitas outras que estão por vir.\n\nDa mesma forma, ex-Googlers que se tornaram executivos ou VCs envolvidos com as principais empresas do Vale do Silício (_Facebook, Dropbox, Pinterest_, etc), elas agora conhecem pessoas em muitas grandes empresas de lá.\n\nAs pessoas que investiram, tornaram se sócias ou membro do conselho da empresa que você trabalha lhe conhecerá ao longo do tempo e impactara sua carreira. Fazer parte da rede certa no início da carreira lhe trará oportunidades interessantes. Podemos fazer que é _sorte_, acredito que podemos ter sorte, mas nem todas as pessoas estarão preparadas para abraçar a oportunidade (_sorte_) que passa em sua frente, não sabemos o momento que ela vai passar - você tem se preparado ou vai perder mais uma oportunidade?\n\nMercado e taxa de crescimento\n\nNo início de nossa carreira profissional, o mercado que escolhemos começar será um fator determinante para o seu sucesso profissional. Entrar em uma empresa com grande mercado lhe abrira diversas oportunidades de crescimento na empresa atual e outras empresas querendo lhe contratar - o que fazemos hoje colhemos no futuro.\n\nMuitos profissionais que passaram pela Netscape para o Google, do Google para o Facebook e agora do Facebook para outras empresas líderes da Internet. Traçando um paralelo: os profissionais que fizeram parte das empresas de telecomunicação nos anos 90 provavelmente ainda estão na Cisco (se não estudaram e tiveram _sorte_), tenha calma e escolha sabiamente o mercado que quer trabalhar.\n\nSei que no começo da nossa vida profissional só queremos qualquer emprego, mas tente pensar estrategicamente onde quer chegar, isso lhe ajudará dizer não para o que não faz sentido em sua vida profissional.\n\nTenha opções - seja flexível\n\nVocê tem ocupado sempre a mesma posição profissional? Ou pode estar uma posição que vai preparar você para uma nova posição?\n\nQual é a próximo cargo que você quer chegar? Você consegue trabalhar em um novo mercado (por exemplo, entrar na área farmacêutica) ou ocupar uma nova função (ocupar uma posição no time de produto ao invés de engenharia)?\n\nGeralmente nos limitamos fazendo a mesma coisa por diversas vezes, ao invés de aprender coisas novas (não é fácil sair da zona de conforto). Ser especialista é importante quando temos anos de experiência, não no começo de nossa vida profissional.\n\nMarca de peso - isso pode ser importante\n\nO nome da empresa que você trabalha é importante, principalmente se você nunca teve experiencia trabalhando em grandes times. Se você é formado em uma grande universidade (exemplo MIT) e trabalhou como engenheiro no Google, as pessoas vão assumir que você é um grande engenheiro, à reputação da instituição passará para você. Se você tiver 1 ou 2 marcas esse ponto é menos importante, eu olharia para os outros fatores listado acima.\n\n---\n\nPara o blogpost não ficar grande e com uma leitura massante quebrei ele em 2 partes (ainda não terminei de escrever a segunda, ou seja, pode ser que seja mais 😊).",

    "content" : "Fazer deploy de software desenvolvido usando tecnologias que foram criadas para ter escalabilidade vertical para escalar horizontalmente (_micro serviço, nano serviço_ e etc) em produção pode gerar alguns desafios que não estamos preparados. Principalmente quando o software esta rodando em JVM e não foi declarado limites de recursos.\n\n-Xms, -Xmx e seus problemas\n\nAo estudar sobre a JVM você provavelmente passara pelos parâmetros de alocação inicial (Xms) e alocação máxima (Xmx) de memória, os parâmetros funcionam rigorosamente bem. Trazendo um exemplo, ao definir -Xms128M e Xmx256M, e começar monitorar a aplicação com VisualVM, você alguma como essa:\n\n\n\n``shell\njava -Xms128m -Xmx256m hello.java\n`\n\nAo ler a documentação da JVM (a parte de Sizing the Generations) parece que funcionara como magica, no exemplo acima a aplicação querer mínimo de 128Mb de memória (JVM alocará assim que a aplicação iniciar), mas não deixando passar do limite de 256Mb. Vamos dar uma olhada como ficou na prática:\n\n\n\n`java\npublic class Hello {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        while (true) {\n            new Hello().hello();\n            Thread.sleep(1000);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public void hello() {\n        System.out.println(Hello, World);\n    }\n}\n`\n\n😱 não saiu como eu imaginava, parece que usou um pouco mais que 256Mb... O motivo desse comportamento é que a JVM usa memória para outros processos como metaspace, cache de código e etc, o Xmx limita só sua aplicação não a JVM como todo.\n\nAlguns cuidados que precisamos ter ao limitar recursos\n\nAo rodar software dentro do Kubernetes, temos que ter atenção no limite físico das máquinas que fazem parte do Cluster Kubernetes, para um pod não consumir todo recurso e outros pods acabar _morrendo_.\n\nVou testar exemplificar...\n\nConfigurando Xms e Xmx na imagem Docker\n\nVocê pode passar estas flags (parâmetros) para JVM subir seu JAR na imagem Docker:\n\n`dockerfile\nDockerfile\n...\nENTRYPOINT [java, -Xms128M , -Xmx256m, -jar, hello-service-1.0.0.jar]\n`\n\nCaso esteja usando Jib, pode declarar dentro do build.gradle:\n\n`gradle\n// build.gradle\njib {\n    to {\n        image = hello-service:tag\n    }\n    container {\n        environment = [JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS: -Xms128M -Xmx256M]\n    }\n}\n`\n\nLimitando memória dos pods no Kubernetes\n\nAo usar Xmx no pods você pode facilmente chegar em uma configuração que causará restart contante, por motivos de _Exceed a Container's memory limit (OOM)_\n, por motivos a limite de memória, lembre do printscreen acima que mesmo limitando a aplicação a 256Mb a JVM usou mais de 700Mb. Dependendo do seu software deve ser definido o limite de recurso no próprio Kubernetes no YAML do seu deployment:\n\n`yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n...\nspec:\n  ...\n  template:\n    ...\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - image: hello-service:tag\n          name: hello-service\n          livenessProbe:\n            initialDelaySeconds: 300\n          resources:\n            requests:\n              memory: 128Mi\n            limits:\n              memory: 256Mi\n`\n\nVou assumir que você declarou os limites acima para seus pods, já que você também declarou os mesmos limites na sua imagem Docker via flags -Xms e  -Xmx. Você faz deploy do seu software, ele funciona _perfeitamente_, como não teve problema vai para cama descansar (geralmente colocar software em produção é cansativo). No dia seguinte você da roda kubectl get pods para ter orgulho de ter colocado seu software no ~~Kubernetes~~ e se depara com isso:\n\n`shell\n❯ ~ kubectl get pods\nNAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nhello-service-3x85997760-qapo7     1/1     Running   156        9h\n`\n\n💣 você não esperava ver isso né? Agora que conhece como funciona a JVM (com printscren do htop) você já sabe o que esta acontecendo: o uso de memória da JVM não é só do seu software, então ele é morto diversas vezes (campo RESTARTS do get pods) porquê o pod passou do limite de memória declarado e entra em um fluxo sem fim de _restart_.\n\nAbordagem correta\n\nPrimeiro de tudo: assumiremos que os limites dentro da sua imagem Docker estejam bem definidos - com o que o software realmente precisa. Caso você queira reservar um valor fixo de memória para seu software e não ter concorrência com outro, você deve declarar Xms = Xmx, mas _use com moderação_.\n\nPara evitar _Exceed a Container's memory limit_ no pods do Kubernetes, você deve considerar os seguintes itens:\n\n1. requests (parâmetro do resources) != Xms - o valor do requests deve ser maior que Xms, essa diferença depende do que seu software fará. Caso seja um _micro serviço_ simples, ~30% de acréscimo é o suficiente, mas se seu software tem muitas conexões externas ou qualquer operação que consome memória recomendo estudar a particularidade do seu software;\n2. limits (parâmetro do resources) != Xmx - O limite de memória sugerido para seu pod depende de muitas coisas e a imagem base do Java usada é um fator extremamente importante. Não vou passar um valor nem fórmula ~~magica~~, recomendo fazer diversos benchmarks para conhecer melhor o software que esta desenvolvendo;\n3. Declarar limits com valores mais alto no começo é sempre uma boa prática, mas ir otimizando (diminuindo ou aumentando) conforme for conhecendo o comportamento do seu software em produção, sempre monitorando se o pod não entra em OOM;\n4. livenessProbe.initialDelaySeconds - Tempo que o Kubernetes deve esperar seu software subir (JVM) antes de dar que não funcionou. Esse parâmetro é complicado, JVM tem fama de ser lenta para fazer boot, se seu software tem muitas conexões externas ela levará mais tempo.\n\nOlhando para o caso que foi descrito acima: declarar requests como ~320Mb e limits como ~512Mb seria um ótimo começo dado os valores do Xms e Xmx.\n\n> Não existe bala de prata, a melhor forma de chegar em valores reais para limites de recursos no Kubernetes é conhecer seu software e fazer benchmarks para entender o comportamento dele, acada software é único e se comporta de uma forma diferente.\n\n> Recentemente coloquei um micro serviço usando Spring Boot para rodar e o serviço não subia, depois de horas e horas debugando e brigando com limite recurso do software e Kubernetes percebi que o problema era o initialDelaySeconds`. _#ficaadica_",

    "content" : "Em nossa vida é necessário encarar de frente assuntos considerados difíceis ou tabu com qualquer pessoa, para isso precisamos ter coragem e maturidade para lidar com naturalidade com qualquer tema - mesmo se ele nos tire da zona de conforto.\n\nPara falar sobre esse assunto, vamos começar pelo porquê.\n\nPor que é comum procrastinar uma conversa quando envolve assunto difícil?\n\nQuando não falamos constantemente sobre um tipo de assunto ele se torna difícil por falta de familiaridade e sensação de desconforto. Por exemplo, é comum as pessoas terem dificuldade para falar sobre sexo, dinheiro, relacionamento, homossexualidade, etc.\n\n- Sexo: geralmente é um tabu e tratado com sigilo;\n- Dinheiro: o brasileiro tem um problema estrutural na educação financeira e falar de dinheiro com nossa família geralmente soa errado, principalmente quando estamos em uma mesa de jantar;\n- Relacionamento: quando está tudo bem é fácil, mas quando tem algo nos incomodando entendemos que não é tão fácil assim;\n- Homossexualidade: nossa, falar disso é desnecessário, mas não é;\n- ... posso passar horas e horas listando assuntos que a grande maioria das pessoas fogem\n\n> Conversas difíceis são… difíceis!\nMas podemos deixar elas mais confortáveis\n\nAgora que estamos alinhados sobre o que é um assunto difícil: vamos trazer para nossa vida profissional.\n\n\n\nFalar o que as pessoas não estão preparados para escutar\n\nDepois de anos trabalhando em ambientes de startups, percebo que muitos gestores não querem escutar assuntos que gerem desconforto e sim assuntos que massageiem os seus egos.\n\nMinha realidade é diferente da sua e isso esta diretamente relacionado a como chegamos até aqui, dado as experiências que vivi, amizades, ambientes que frequentei etc. O que é obvio para mim, pode não ser para você.\n\nAo chegar para um amigo (a) de trabalho e falar de um assunto complicado que a pessoa ainda não tem consciência, é gerado um nível alto de estresse e cada pessoa tem uma forma de lidar com informações que os gera desconforto, medo, angústia e ansiedade.\n\nQuando temos a consciência de que cada pessoa vai reagir de uma forma diferente, precisamos ter empatia e estruturar a conversa de uma forma que ela fique menos desconfortável, deixando extremamente claro a mensagem final que queremos passar. E de uma forma compreensível pela outra parte, ou seja, não levar no freestyle (sair falando sem antes ter estruturado a conversa) quando estamos falando de assuntos difíceis.\n\nTenho o habito de escrever tudo o que fiz e que irei fazer, invisto mais tempo em planejamento e estruturando uma conversa do que de fato tendo a conversa difícil. Não estou falando que é rápida a reunião com assunto desconfortável e sim que o planejamento (estruturação) da reunião leva mais tempo que a própria reunião — sei que isso pode soar estranho para as pessoas que entram em reunião sem se prepararem.\n\nSabe quando você olha seu calendário de trabalho e tem uma reunião atrás da outra sem ter pelo menos 15 minutos para respirar? Pode ser que você não esteja preparado para essa reunião e seria melhor não participar da reunião.\n\nAlguns assuntos se tornam difíceis por não sabermos dizer não, mas isso é assunto para um próximo texto, quem sabe em breve escrevo sobre isso.\n\nExpor o problema e propor a solução\n\nQuantas vezes você expôs um problema da empresa e não propôs uma possível solução? Não precisa ser a solução final e sim uma solução que você acredite que dará certo. Se está inseguro da proposta, pode expor isso para todos e envolver as pessoas para contribuírem na construção da solução — um time vai muito mais longe quando joga junto.\n\n~~Infelizmente eu já fiz isso, apontei o dedo para o problema sem se quer pensar em como resolver.~~\n\nTodas as empresas têm diversos problemas a serem solucionados ou pontos que precisam de melhorias, se você acha que existe a empresa perfeita esta enganado (a).\n\nSei que muitas empresas têm a cultura de fazerem as tomadas de decisões topdown (dos diretores para o time), não dando espaço para o time (você faz parte dele) proporem melhorias.\n\n> Será que a empresa que você está é a empresa que você gostaria de estar? Se a resposta for não, você está planejando sua saída dela? Olha aí nós falando sobre um assunto difícil.\n\nEstruturando conversas difíceis com padrão A, B e C\n\n- A: Fale de casos concretos, dando exemplos do que aconteceu: Eu vi que você fez isso, Eu ouvi aquilo, ~~Alguém me disse~~ que tal coisa aconteceu (cuidado com esse, telefone sem fio existe) e ...\n- B: Descreva o impacto que esse fato gerou em você: Você fez A e eu me senti desrespeitado ou Você não entregou o que combinamos e fiquei com a impressão de que você não entendeu a importância do que está fazendo.\nÉ possível mencionar como você se sentiu, mas sem a carga emocional.\n- C: Busque a posição da outra pessoa de forma interrogativa: Podemos conversar sobre esse assunto?, Você pode me explicar o que aconteceu?, Você tem algo a dizer a esse respeito? ou ainda Escutei isso e gostaria de compartilhar minhas impressões com você, ok?.\n\nDessa forma você não mantém o ambiente psicologicamente seguro com espaço aberto para diálogo, não queremos culpar e sim dialogar. Ninguém quer participar de uma conversa quando começa com conclusões.\n\nComo queremos um dialogo, nada mais justo que pedir licença antes de entrar no espaço do outro, é muito mais que sinal de respeito e educação, abrindo espaço para a pessoa expor seu ponto de vista.\n\n> Por último aprenda escutar e só depois que a pessoa terminar você fala.\n\nConseguiu entender meu ponto de vista? Não é fácil e exige muita consciência e pensar antes, durante e depois destas conversas. Mas é questão de prática e ação. Deixe seu comentário sobre o que você pensa sobre esse assunto.",

Planejamento: Após estabelecer objetivo e metas, é organizá-los. Crie planilhas e documentos com o que precisa ser concluído, quais os prazos e as prioridades. Assim tenho ciência do que é necessário ser desenvolvido e quais pessoas preciso envolver (no meu caso profissionais do esporte) para a concretização do que foi planejado inicialmente;\n1. Disciplina (dedicação): Motivação nos faz começar, disciplina é o que nos levará  para próxima meta. Tenha em mente o que é necessário para alcançar seu objetivo e motive-se para cumprir cada meta. Sem dedicação, persistência e resiliência (ser antifrágil, aprender com os erros e acertos), podemos nos perder no meio do caminho, mas busque não desistir no meio do caminho. O planejamento pode (e irá) falar, mas com disciplina chegamos lá;\n1. Objeto claro (e metas): Quando temos claro o que estamos fazendo e porque estamos fazendo, alcançar a próxima meta rumo ao objetivo fica muito mais fácil por conseguir contar com nossa motivação, mas tenha certeza que não é todos os dias que irá acordar motivado.\n\nO mais importante é ter compromisso connosco, se disse para mim que iria fazer, por que não vou fazer?

Porém, algumas pessoas acabam confundindo esses dois termos e, com isso, podem ter problemas em defini-los, principalmente na hora de criar um planejamento para alcançar as metas e objetivos pessoal/profissional.\n\nObjetivo? Dar descrição concreta de onde queremos chegar, ou o que estamos tentando alcançar (direção), ou seja, o propósito. O objetivo é estratégico e abrangente.\n\nMetas? Andando em direção ao objetivo, as metas são tarefas específicas para alcançá-lo, sendo que elas são temporais, ou seja, têm prazo específico para acontecer. Por exemplo, se o seu objetivo é fazer IRONMAN 70.3 de São Paulo em 2021, suas metas serão traçar caminhos que te levarão ao objetivo, ou seja, você deve quebrar o objetivo em diversas metas:\n- Treinar X horas por dia/semana;\n- Dar feedback diariamente sobre percepção do treino para o coach;\n- Seguir a dieta diariamente com um total X calorias por semana;\n- Participar dos treinos presenciais aos sábados junto com a assessoria esportiva;\n- Fazer prova X, Y e Z;\n- e assim sucessivamente...\n\nObjetivo deve ser único e as metas é o que nos levará até o objetivo.\nObjetivo sem meta é sonho 🧠\n\n----\n\nOriginally published at instagram.com/avelinorun",

Ex: estou com XXX de FITNESS, FORM e FATIGUE. Tenha profissionais para auxiliar você entender e propor métricas.\n- A: Attainable (Atingível): Lembre-se que não temos super poderes, estabeleça um objetivo real, que esteja dentro da sua realidade. Se IRONMAN 70.3 é muito, comece com SPRINT.\n- R: Relevant/Realistic (Relevante/Realista): Você deve se perguntar qual é o benefício desse objetivo para você, se vai lhe ajudar no seu crescimento pessoal. Seja critico com você - jogue duro.\n- T: Time-bound (Tempo limite): Seu objetivo precisa ter um prazo para ser alcançado.

Algumas horas depois do primeiro dia de aula a professora tomou ciência do problema e mandou mensagem para todos os pais orientando colocar no mute e só liberando o microfone quando o aluno tivesse duvida, ela mudou a forma de perguntar passando para o modo de negação quem não entendeu?, assim minimizando o número de alunos falar ao mesmo tempo, e abrindo espaço para os que tem dúvida falar.\n\nO processo de adaptação para as crianças foram menos de 1 semana, porque nós adultos levamos tanto tempo para nos adaptar?\n\nEstudo dizem que alguns hábitos levam em torno de 254 dias para formar - a maior parte de um ano!

Quando disso sim para o desafio minha preparação foi 100% mental - física sabia que não teria tempo hábito - com muita meditação, técnica de mentalização e descontração (aprendido no DeROSE Method).\n\nSabia que precisava de uma motivação extra por estar dentro de casa, com tudo me motivando para parar (geladeira, sofá, Netflix, trabalho, família e tudo que temos dentro de casa), mas eu disse sim e usei alguns mind hacking para fazer meu cérebro chegar até o fim, o principal foi a pressão social. Acredito que você nunca tenha visto eu falando no story e ontem foi dia de reportar cada etapa da prova, cobrança mental por se expor em público para começar e chegar ao fim.\n\nOutro ponto extremamente importante foi envolver a família no desafio, com meu filho de staff (aquela pessoa que lhe ajuda quando precisa de algum, por exemplo pegar o próximo esquisse de água), à esposa como apoio do filho que poderia não lembrar onde estava alguma coisa e principalmente me motivar em momentos difíceis (sabia que chegaria o KM 15 da meia maratona), ela é casca grosa quando o assunto é chegar ao fim de um desafio - _Samara Avelino_ valeu por jogar duro comigo nesse desafio!\n\nOs primeiros 5km de esteira foi tranquilo, praticamente foi o tempo do corpo esquentar e começar o pedal sem precisar girar com cadência alta, como já estava quente os primeiro 50km foi tranquilo, após o 50km foi momento de começar sentir os glúteos e músculos das coxas queimar (não muito). Subi na esteira forte e com muita energia, como tinha tomado muito líquido para hidratação no KM 8 comecei sentir vontade ir ao banho, mas segurei até o KM 10, até que chegou no tão esperado KM 15 - aqui foi onde começou o desafio - onde comecei me arrastar até o KM 18 aonde voltou a fluir, chegando super bem no KM 21.\n\nTerminei me sentindo super forte e muito bem por ter passado por mais esse desafio psicológico. Em nem um momento passou em minha cabeça que não iria conseguir.\n\nCérebro que manda no corpo!",

    "content" : "Vamos começar com um assunto complicado, expor nossas fraquezas não são muito fácil né? Mas depois de supera-lá acho importante compartilhar como foi aquela luta.\n\nQual é seu atual IRONMAN? Nesse texto usarei o nome IRONMAN como um sinônimo de desafio que você julga muito complicado, onde envolve muito treino, dedicação e perseverança.\n\nAgora senta que lá vem textão:\nNo carnaval resolvi não ir para Salvador (como já tinha planejado 1 ano a traz), nem ir para bloquinhos em São Paulo e sim ir para o Lobo Tri Experience (aka mini Camp), onde passaríamos 4 dias treinando no período da manhã. No dia 25/12 (último dia do camp) fecharíamos com 4 simulados, ou seja, nadar, pedalar correr e voltava tudo novamente. E lá vou eu mais uma vez para um lugar onde teria que vencer uma das aflições internas a tal Águas Abertas, pois é falo de Triathlon a +- 3 anos e águas abertas ainda era (vamos rasgar o verbo do presente e usar passado) um desafio interno, nunca queria estar ali e sempre negligenciando os treinos de natação.\n\nQuando entrei na água, senti que não estava legal, só queria sair correndo de lá para casa e ficar em posição fetal, mas se estou dentro da água bora nadar.\nToca a buzina do primeiro simulado e vai o fanfarrão dando braçada forte, sem respirar direito e com menos de 200m me sinto perdido no meio da represa sem ninguém do meu lado, bate aquele desespero e minha cabeça assume o controle do meu corpo com diversas afirmações e questionamentos:\n\n o que estou fazendo aqui?\n a primeira boia nunca chega!\n não irei aguentar!\n não estou conseguindo nem boiar!\n vou voltar!\n\nOlho para o lado e vejo o caiaque se aproximando e o coach Jose Belarmino do meu lado, vendo eu me desesperando, ao olhar para ele começa um diálogo no meio da represa:\n\nA: Zé, não aguento vou voltar!\n\nZé: Calma Avelino, segura no caiaque e tira os óculos\n\nA: Zé, você não esta entendendo, fodeu não irei aguentar!\n\nZé: Calma Avelino, respira, tira os óculos, olhe para trás e veja o quanto já nadou, olhe para frente e veja o quanto falta para a primeira boia\n\nEle estava fazendo eu me acalmar e me colocar no estado presente (estudo e vivo muito mindfulness, mas ali não estava rolando), após me acalmar e me colocar no estado presente foi momento de voltar nadar, por fim levei 23 minutos para fazer 500m, sai d'agua destruído e muito abalado. Chegou o momento que mais gosto do triathlon, o tal pedal, quando saio na estrada para pedalar, sinto que algo estava diferente e não conseguia fazer força, comecei tentar fazer respiratória para ajudar na recuperação muscular, porem não fluiu. A corrida consegui sair forte com o pace de 4:50, mas terminei morrendo.\nSe você se lembra tinha mais 3x, entrar na água pela segunda vez era tudo que eu menos queria, entrei sentindo calafrio de medo, angustia e ansiedade, a primeira natação tinha me destruído psicologicamente e não consegui segurar as rédias. Lá foi eu, dessa vez fluiu melhor na parte de respiração, mas o tempo foi para o vinagre, o pedal e corrida não encaixava e acabei jogando a toalha devendo 2x.\n\nNo final do treino foi momento de bater um papo com o coach, comecei a conversa falando que não iria conseguir fazer a prova do dia 15/3 e mais 1001 frases negativas. Quando dei tempo para ele falar, olhou para mim e falou para ter calma e que precisaria entrar mais em águas abertas para perder esse medo.\n\nApós chegar em casa e chorar muito (sim meus olhos ficou repleto de suor kkk), dois dias depois desse capítulo tinha plena certeza que _triathlon não era para mim_, olhei algumas provas de duathlon (sem água) e blábláblá, mas eu que quiz fazer triathlon, ninguém me forçou a isso. No terceiro dia após o acontecido caiu minha ficha, eu que escolhi o triathlon, porque eu estou querendo desistir no primeiro desafio?\nForam 2 semanas até aqui, fazendo natação todos os dias focando na correção da respiração e técnica, alguns dias foram de águas abertas, ficando na boia de 50m, sabe quando uma criança entra na água pela primeira vez e treme de medo? Era eu quando entrava na represa.\n\nApós essas 2 semanas foi dia de fazer simulado (hoje 07/03/2020), fiz tudo diferente da outra vez:\n\n queria esta ali\n antes de sair nadando fiz bastante respiração\n fiz o corpo a costumar com a água\n* nadei 100m para aquecer o mínimo possível\n\nE fui, após nadar 1000m, sai da água super bem e forte para seguir com o pedal e corrida!\n\nParo a história por aqui para voltar ao conteúdo desse texto, com a seguinte pergunta:\n\n> Qual seu atual IRONMAN?\n\nO meu IRONMAN era essa tal de águas abertas, para vencer ele foi com base em meta, foco, perseverança e método.\n\nNão tente abraçar o mundo, foque no seu IRONMAN, após passar por ele curta cada segunda de sua conquista antes de ir para próxima meta.",

Como tinha acabado de chegar na área, não sabia o ambiente (locais) onde as pessoas desenvolvedora de software frequentava, depois de muita pesquisa me deparei com uma conferência de Python fora de São Paulo, e lá fui eu sair da zona de conforto, na emoção de ter achado essa conferencia, comprei passagem e hospedagem próximo à universidade que seria a conferência, assim que comprei comecei alimentar alguns bichos dentro da minha cabeça (medo do desconhecido e novo, quem sabe no futuro escrevo alguma coisa sobre o assunto):\n\n Todo mundo deve se conhecer, ficarei deslocado!\n Será palestras muita avançada, não irei entender nada!\n Como puxarei assunto com uma pessoa desenvolvedora de Python sendo que conheço pouco da linguagem?\n O que motiva essa galera está lá? Não deve ser o mesmo motivo que eu!\n* … mais uma porrada de afirmação sem embasamento\n\nPensei diversas vezes em não ir, na real alguns dias após a compra das passagens tinha certeza que não iria e só tinha gastado dinheiro. Chegando na data próximo da conferência consegui me convencer que iria e caso não tivesse interação com o pessoal iria conhecer a cidade.\n\nApós vencer os bichos que tinha dentro da minha cabeça e dar o primeiro passo (ou segundo porque o primeiro foi comprar as passagens), foi momento de focar no ambiente e tentar absorver o máximo que podia e conhecer pessoas (julga esse ponto ser o divisor de águas da minha carreira), foi momento de voltar para casa sabendo onde poderia encontrar outras conferências locais (na minha cidade) para respirar o mesmo ar que a galera. Com o passar do tempo comecei ajudar o Grupy-SP (Grupo de usuários Python da cidade de São Paulo), nesse momento ainda não existia usávamos lista de e-mail e canal no IRC para comunicação e todos os eventos eram publicados no Wiki da Python Brasil.\n\nQuando quero aprender alguma coisa que não domino, meu primeiro passo é sair da zona de conforte e ir estudar por conta, depois é buscar locais que tenha pessoas que domine o assunto que eu quero aprender, isso serve para acelerar meu conhecimento, aprender o que não fazer com quem tem experiência (errou muito), assim evito passar horas e horas onde não me levará a lugar algum. Quando estamos estudando um tema novo é muito comum nos perdermos com o que estudar (perder o foco) ou colocar esforços em conteúdo que não deveríamos no momento atual.\n\n> Frequente ambiente que tenha pessoas melhores que você!",

Compressão no conteúdo, dado que é XML poderia tirar espaço e/ou alguns parâmetros que não usamos, mas estaria postergando o problema, no futuro poderia voltar ter o mesmo problema;\n2. Alterar a estrutura de registro salvando 1 registro para controlar outros N registro com documento feito split (dividindo a string);\n3. Alterar o limite do tamanho máximo da coleção;\n4. GridFS (recomendação do MongoDB, _To store documents larger than the maximum size, MongoDB provides the GridFS API_).\n\nNo primeiro momento a _solução 3_ me parecia ser ótima, bastava mudar o tamanho do limite máximo pré definido pelo MongoDB (para criação de novos documentos) e tudo funcionaria perfeitamente, olhando a documentação (alterar a opção nsSize) é extremamente simples, de fato a alteração no MongoDB é simples, porém o drive do MongoDB para Python seta os _16mb_ em variável interna para tratar documentos, alterar esse limite não é tão trivial, seria necessário fazer monkey patch ou um fork do drive, quando cheguei nesse momento foi o momento de tirar o pé do acelerador e pensar na próxima alternativa.\n\nPara o próximo passo a _solução 2_ me parecia ser ótima, até ter que lidar com uma grande string e ter que colocar grandes funções para tratar tamanho de strings menores, isso que não cheguei no momento de ter um registro para controlar outros registros. Ao ver o começo da implementação a complexidade me fez abrir mão e passar para próxima opção.\n\nAs soluções listadas acima foi mais ou menos a ordem até chegar na solução 4.\n\nSolução final\n\nO software envia para o MongoDB para salvar como uma collection normal, quando recebemos o erro de documento muito grande, tratamos o erro criando um arquivo no GridFS com o conteúdo do XML e colocando a referência do arquivo criado na estrutura do documento, ficando da seguinte forma:\n\n    {\n        headers: {},\n        gridfs: ObjectID(), // ID interno de referência do mongodb\n        status_code: 200 // http status code\n    }\n\nNo software que lê esse documento fazemos uma condição if tratando se existe o nó gridfs:\n\n    obj = mongodb.find_one({...})\n    if obj.get('gridfs'):\n        fs = GridFS(...)\n        body = fs.get(obj['gridfs'])\n        obj['body'] = body.read()\n        obj.pop('gridfs')\n    return obj\n\nDessa forma retornamos a mesma estrutura independente de onde foi salvo o conteúdo (próprio documento ou GridFS), assim ficando agnóstico para o software lê os dados.\n\nNem tudo funciona tão bem como esperamos (não existe bala de prata), alguns pontos extremamente importantes para ter conhecimento:\n\n Leitura e escrita no GridFS é mais lenta que um documento;\n* Estamos armazenando dados em outra coleção do MongoDB, ou seja, o processo de limpeza do banco de dados agora precisa olhar para outras coleções (como mencionado é um dado transitório, podemos apagar todos os dados a qualquer momento), usamos Expire Data via TTL do MongoDB.",

Sair de uma vida muito sedentária para prática de esporte.\n\nO estopim sem sombra de dúvida foi medo de morrer, após alguns exames no cardiologista recebi a notícia nas últimas 2 horas tive 3 começo de infarto, sei o que é um infarto, mas o que é um começo de infarto?\n\n O que me fez fazer academia e praticar esporte?\n\nApós +- 2 meses da cirurgia bariátrica o médico falou que já poderia ir para academia, minha resposta para ele foi como assim ir para academia? Não era só fazer a cirurgia e perderia peso?, nesse momento que tive a sensação de ser enganado 🤔. Lá fui eu, chegando na academia vem uma pessoa toda animada e perguntou qual era meu propósito, mentalmente veio a resposta sei lá, minha mãe mandou, na tentativa de cortar o assunto ali, falei que queria correr (confesso que não sei porquê dessa resposta), porém ele continuou o assunto, mais quer correr prova de 5, 10, 21, 42km? , louco para fugir do assunto minha resposta foi o que não sabia e só queria correr.\n\nFui para esteira parecendo um rato correndo, na real me arrastando que nem trotar eu conseguia, mas percebi que no momento que estava na esteira não conseguia pensar em nada além de prestar atenção para não cair, comecei usar esse momento para me desconectar e viver aquele momento. Após alguns meses treinando fiz uma prova de 5, 10 e 18km - sempre chegando no final morrendo -, mas o corredor sempre quer mais KMs, chegando no fim da prova de 18km com muita endorfina comecei pensar para onde eu iria e veio na minha mente a marca do IRONMAN (até então não sabia o que era, apenas lembrei do nome), chegando em caso foi momento de pesquisar e entender que era triathlon, mas o que é triathlon? Quando entendi que era nadar, pedalar e correr, falei para mim isso é fácil, eu já estou correndo, fiz natação quando tinha 7 anos de idade e pedalo desde criança, será tranquilo, inocente eu né KKKKKJKK.\n\nOlhando para meu pensamento de 2016, não sabia pedalar e sim andar de bicicleta, não nadava e sim boiava e correr prefiro não comentar (nem trote era 😜).\n\nTriathlon é estilo de vida (lifestyle)!\n\nEm resumo estou no triathlon pelo psicológico, escrevi alguns textos porque estou no triathlon, você deve achar aí na timeline.",

    "content" : "A pergunta que os atletas que segue dieta baseada em plantas recebe é a suposição de que os alimentos de origem animal são a única fonte de proteína, isso é um equívoco, mas infelizmente muitas pessoas têm essa visão por falta de informação.\n\nNa verdade:\n\n Uma porção de brócolis cozido ou espinafre tem tanta proteína como um ovo médio (6 gramas)\n Espirulina (alga azul-esverdeada) é o alimento mais denso em proteínas do planeta\n 3 colheres de sopa de sementes de cânhamo têm proteína igual a 1/2 xícara de iogurte grego (10 gramas), além de 6 gramas de ácidos graxos ômega 3\n\nNos _Estados Unidos_, a recomendação diária de proteína (RDA) é 0,8 gramas por quilograma de peso corporal. Porém, esta recomendação destina-se a simplesmente manter funções corporais básicas, a ingestão diária de proteínas deve ser maior para a maioria das pessoas. Pesquisas mostram que os atletas de alta performance deve ingerir aproximadamente 50% mais proteína do que pessoas sedentárias - 1.2 - 2.0/kg de proteína diariamente - dependendo da fase de treinamento, dependendo de peso, dieta, gênero e idade.\n\nProteína vegetal\n\nAminoácidos são os blocos de construção da proteína. Dos 20 aminoácidos, seu organismo é capaz de produzir 11 deles - eles são conhecidos como aminoácidos não essenciais. Os outros 9 são denominados aminoácidos essenciais - eles não são produzidos pelo organismo e devem ser ingeridos através de alimentos.\n\nAlimentos de origem animal (carne, laticínios e ovos) contêm aminoácidos essenciais em quantidades aproximadamente iguais. Alimentos vegetais como quinoa, trigo-sarraceno, espirulina, soja, chia, grão-de-bico e pães também contêm os 9, mas a maioria dos alimentos vegetais tem ausência de pelo menos um aminoácido essencial. Mas não precisamos de todos os aminoácidos em cada mordida de alimentos, alcançar e manter a síntese de proteína do corpo requer uma dieta que inclui uma variedade de proteínas vegetais, incluindo grãos integrais, legumes, nozes, sementes e legumes.\n\nA lisina (fórmula C6H14N2O2) é o único aminoácido essencial que é difícil de obter em uma dieta _vegana_, porque as plantas contêm quantidade muito baixa. Lisina é um precursor da carnitina (fórmula C7H15NO3), molécula-chave na oxidação beta (a conversão de ácidos graxos em energia). Carnitina auxilia remover toxinas do músculo, reduz o colesterol, e ajuda na produção de colágeno - principal proteína estrutural do corpo encontrada no osso, cartilagem, tendões, ligamentos e pele.\n\nDieta mista que inclui carne, ovos e/ou laticínios fornece 60 - 180mg por dia de carnitina, enquanto dieta vegana fornece 10 - 12mg. Por esses motivos atletas com dietas a base de plantas (veganos) deve ingerir proteína vegetal com grandes fontes de lisina. Os alimentos mais ricos em Lisina incluem tempeh, lentilhas, tofu germinado, amaranto, quinoa, pistache, grão-de-bico e sementes de abóbora.\n\nProteína e Performance\n\nPessoas pode se safar com uma dieta vegana abaixo do ideal; no entanto, o aumento do volume de treino e corrida pode levar a má performance, recuperação e saúde para atletas vegano.\n\nAlguns riscos:\n\n Falta de açúcar no sangue, as fontes de proteína vegetal contém mais carboidratos e menos gordura, comparada com proteínas animais. Isso pode resultar em ineficiência metabólica e diminuição da capacidade de usar gordura como energia, além de menos saciedade e aumento no desejo de açúcar.\n Baixa disponibilidade de energia (EA), devido à alta ingestão de fibras, reduz a absorção de calorias e nutrientes. A EA é a quantidade de energia deixada para funções corporais básicas após o gasto energético do exercício ser subtraído da ingestão de energia. Baixo EA pode prejudicar a densidade mineral óssea (BMD), função hormonal, imunidade e função menstrual, entre outros problemas de saúde.\n Deficiências de micronutrientes, incluindo ferro, zinco, vitamina B12, ácidos graxos ômega-3 (EPA/DHA), cálcio e vitamina D. Isto é devido à exclusão das principais fontes de nutrientes e diminuição da absorção devido à alta carga de fibras.\n Má recuperação, devido à remoção de alimentos com alto teor de leucina (presentes nos alimentos lácteos). Leucine é um aminoácido de cadeia ramificada e é fundamental para a recuperação muscular. Atletas (especialmente mulheres) devem obter 3 gramas de leucina a cada 30 minutos de exercício intenso ou longos.\n Diarreia (intestino funcionando mais que o normal), especialmente durante a execução de exercício, relacionada à ingestão de grande volume de fibras.\n Atletas que seguem dieta à base de plantas deve ter acompanhamento regular com nutricionista esportivo.\n\nUm dia com dieta à base de plantas\n\nPlano de refeição a seguir fornece uma variedade de proteínas vegetais ricas em lisina e combinam alimentos ricos em zinco e ferro com vitamina C e atende a exigência diária de vitamina B12, cálcio e ômega-3.\n\n Café da manhã (pré-treino): Aveia ou quinoa com sementes de abóbora e pistache, melaço (para ferro) e bagas (para vitamina C). Adicione leite de nozes (alta proteína), pó de proteína vegetal para proteína extra (ervilha, arroz, chia, amêndoas, amendoim, cânhamo).\n Lanche pós-treino: pudim de chia ou smoothie com proteína em pó de alta leucina e frutas.\n Almoço: Uma salada saudável com folhas verdes (couve, espinafre ou couve para ferro e cálcio), abundância de legumes (beterraba para nitratos, pimentas para vitamina C), grão de bico e tempeh orgânico, abacate (para gorduras ômega-3) e levedura nutricional (para vitamina B12).\n Lanche: pão integral ou legumes em palito com hummus; ou maçã, banana, ou pão integral com manteiga de nozes e sementes de cânhamo.\n Jantar: Feijão ou lentilha com pimentão, tomates e batata-doce. Couves de Bruxelas assadas ou brócolis (proteína extra mais cálcio e vitamina C).\n\nReferências:\n\n1. _Wooding DJ, Packer JE, Kato H, West DWD, Courtney-Martin G, Pencharz, PB, Moore DR.

Na verdade, há diversas diferenças:\n\n Amadores param quando chega a seu objetivo, profissionais entendem que a realização inicial é apenas o começo;\n Amadores têm um objetivo, profissionais têm um processo;\n Amadores pensam que são bons em tudo, profissionais entendem seus círculos de competência;\n Amadores ver feedback e concelho como criticas, profissionais sabem que têm pontos fracos e procuram críticas construtivas;\n Amadores valorizam o desempenho isolado, pense sobre o receptor que pega a bola uma vez em um lance difícil. Profissionais valorizam a consistência, posso pegar a bola na mesma situações 9 vezes em cada 10?\n Amadores desiste no primeiro problema e assumi que é um fracassado, profissionais veem o fracasso como parte do caminho para o crescimento e evolução do ponto fraco;\n Amadores não têm ideia do que melhorar para alcançar bons resultados, profissionais entende;\n Amadores pratica para se divertir, profissionais sabe o que nos treinos ira acontecer no jogo;\n Amadores foca em identificar suas fraquezas e melhorá-las, profissionais focam em seus pontos fortes e em encontrar pessoas que são fortes onde são fracos;\n Amadores pensam que o conhecimento é poder, profissionais transmitem conhecimento e conselhos;\n Amadores foca em ter razão (estar certos), profissionais focam em obter o melhor resultado;\n Amadores foca no pensamento de primeiro nível, profissionais focam no pensamento de segunda ordem.\n Amadores pensa que bons resultados são os seus próprios resultados, profissionais sabe que bons resultados são o resultado das suas ações;\n Amadores foca em curto prazo, profissionais focam a longo prazo;\n Amadores foca em derrubar outras pessoas, profissionais focam em tornar todos melhores;\n Amadores buscam decisões em conjunto para que não haja uma pessoa responsável caso de errado, profissionais tomam decisões por si e aceitam a responsabilidade;\n Amadores buscam culpados, profissionais aceitam a responsabilidade;\n Amadores aparecem de forma inconsistente, profissionais aparecem todos os dias;\n Amadores vão mais rápido, profissionais vão mais longe;\n Amadores vão com a primeira ideia que vem em sua cabeça, profissionais percebem que a primeira ideia raramente é a melhor;\n Amadores acham que sua ideia não pode ser invalidada, profissionais tem certeza que pode;\n Amadores tem pensamento absoluto, profissionais pensam em probabilidades;\n Amadores pensam que a probabilidade de ter a melhor ideia é alta, profissionais sabem que a probabilidade disso é baixa;\n Amadores pensam que a realidade é o que eles querem ver, profissionais sabem que a realidade é a verdade.\n Amadores pensam que a divergência é ameaça, profissional vê como oportunidade de aprender.\n\n> Existem diversas outras diferenças, mas eles podem efetivamente ser resumidos a duas palavras: medo e realidade\n\nAmadores _acreditam_ que o mundo deve trabalhar da maneira que eles querem, profissionais percebem que eles têm que trabalhar com o mundo como ele é. Amadores estão com medo - com medo de ser _vulnerável_ e _honesto_ consigo mesmos, profissionais sentem que são capazes de lidar com quase qualquer adversidade (são resilientes).\n\n'Qual abordagem você acha que vai produzir melhores resultados?'\n\nMotivo de reflexão:\n\n Em qual circunstâncias você se comporta como amador em vez de profissional?\n* O que lhe segura?

    "content" : "_Compreendendo a Psicologia do Flow_\n\nVocê já se sentiu completamente imerso em uma atividade? Se sim, você pode ter experimentado um estado mental que os psicólogos chama de flow, mas o que é isso? Vamos fazer uma analogia para tentar explicar: imagine que você está fazendo uma corrida Sua atenção está focada nos movimentos do seu corpo, na força dos seus músculos, sua respiração e sensação da rua aos seus pés. Você está vivendo aquele momento, totalmente absorvido pelo ato de correr, você está cansado (tem ciência e sensação de cansaço), mas mal percebe o tempo passar.\n\n> De acordo com o psicólogo Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, o que você esta vivendo naquele momento é conhecido com flow, um estado de imersão completa em uma atividade. Ele descreve o estado mental de flow como estar completamente envolvido na atividade para seu próprio bem, o tempo voa, cada ação, movimento e pensamento acontece natualmente, como tocar um estrumento, todo seu ser está envolvido, e você está usando suas habilidades ao máximo.\n\nExperiências de flow geralmente é _ativada_ de maneiras distintas para cada pessoa. Alguns podem experimentar o flow, enquanto esta concentrada em um esporte como triathlon, corrida, esqui, tênis, futebol ou dança, outros podem ter essa experiência enquanto envolvido em atividade de pintura, programação, desenho ou escrita. Estes momentos de flow muitas vezes ocorrem quando você está envolvido em uma atividade que você gosta e tem mais aptidão.\n\nQual sensação de estar em flow?\n\nDe acordo com Csíkszentmihályi, há dez fatores que acompanham a experiência do flow. Embora muitos desses componentes possam estar presentes, não é necessário experimentar _todos_ eles para que o fluxo ocorra:\n\n 1. Objetivos extremamente claros, embora desafiadores, sente que esta próximo de atingir\n 2. Forte concentração e extremamente focado\n 3. A _atividade_ é intrinsecamente gratificante (prazer de esta fazendo)\n 4. Sentimentos de serenidade; perda do sentimento de autoconsciência\n 5. Intemporalidade (_adjetivo usado para qualificar algo ou alguém que não é afetado pelo passar do tempo_); uma sensação distorcida de tempo; sentindo-se tão focado no presente que você perde a noção do tempo passar\n 6. Feedback imediato, seu cérebro lhe da constante informação que esta alcançando suas micro metas\n 7. Sabendo que o objetivo é factível; um equilíbrio entre o nível de habilidade perante ao objetivo\n 8. Sentimentos de controle pessoal sobre a situação\n 9. Falta de consciência das necessidades físicas\n10. Foco completo na atividade\n\nComo chegar ao flow\n\nEm seu livro, _Csíkszentmihályi_ explica que o flow é provável ocorrer quando conseguimos enfrentar o objetivo após desconstruir-ló por diversas vezes, assim somos capazes de ter rápidas respostas do momento que já vivemos (mesmo que mentalmente).\n\nUm jogo de xadrez é um bom exemplo de quando um estado de flow ocorre. Durante uma competição, o jogador tem objetivos e auto feedback muito claro, permitindo que seu foco seja 100% no jogo durante o período da partida.\n\nSe você quer alcançar o estado de flow, esse itens pode te ajudar:\n\n Você ter objetivo e plano de ação extremamente claro\n Objetivo que você gosta ou é apaixonado\n Há elementos de desafios\n Você é capaz de subir nível da habilidade (conhecimento) atual\n\nO flow também acontece quando o objetivo esta totalmente envolvida na superação de um desafio que é gerenciável, por isso funciona como um ímã (lhe prende) para aprender novas habilidades e aumentar os desafios, explica _Csíkszentmihályi_.\n\nBenefícios do flow\n\nAlém de tornar as atividades mais agradáveis, o flow também tem uma série de outras vantagens.\n\n O flow pode levar a alta performance (melhor desempenho). Os pesquisadores encontraram que o flow pode subir o desempenho em uma grande variedade de áreas que incluem o ensino, a aprendizagem, aos atletas (esporte) e o lado criativo\n O flow também pode levar ao aprendizado e desenvolvimento de novas habilidades. Como o ato de alcançar o flow indica o domínio substancial de certa habilidade, o indivíduo deve buscar continuamente novos desafios e informações para manter este estado\n\nLeia também\n\n Mindfulness, hacking mental para concentração plena\n Foco e disciplina é a arma a favor dos seus objetivos\n* Por que triathlon?

Com isso, aprendemos a fazer escolhas mais conscientes e funcionais, influenciando positivamente na maneira como lidamos com os desafios cotidianos.\n\nÉ um dos principais mindhacking que uso para hackear minha mente e focar nos treinos e alcançar meus objetivos.",

Por fim sai para correr, os passos não encaixavam, meu pace estava abaixo da planilha (treino que teria que rodar), não conseguia me desconectar, ou seja, não estava fluindo.

Incrível como nosso cérebro tenta nos deixar na zona de conforto.\n\nTem uma galera que manda mensagem me perguntando como faço para conseguir ter ânimo para treinar todos os dias e seguir com disciplina, a minha resposta sempre será ter objetivo claro, metas de curto, médio e longo prazo (objetivo diário, semanal, mensal, anual e de vida), mas é uma luta diária para conseguir, nada vem fácil em nossas vidas.\n\nÉ uma briga comigo mesmo (psicológica), quer entender o que me chama atenção no Triathlon leia esse blogpost: Por que triathlon?

Por que o titulo Diga mais SIM, coloque foco no que você realmente quer?\n\nComo comentei _durante anos falava_ (passado, busco sempre evoluir, a principio para melhor e me forço sair da zona de conforto S2), quando usava isso com afirmação estava passando uma mensagem _subliminar para meu cérebro_ para focar no meu objetivo, isso me gerava esforço desnecessario e uma volta para lembro qual era meu real proposito de dizer NÃO.\n\nHoje digo sim para meu objetivo, com isso falo não para tudo que sai fora do foco! A primeira vista parece ser a mesma coisa né? Essa simples troca de mindset gera menos consumo mental para dizer não, porque deixa a cada não meu SIM ainda mais claro.

    "content" : "Sempre que inicio um novo ciclo gosto de fazer esse reboot para dar um gás e voltar logo ao ritmo de antes. Esse reboot me ajuda a desinchar, perder peso e acelerar o metabolismo.\n\nSão algumas experiência pessoais e passos que sigo (tem me ajudado muito), não tenho nenhum artigo científico para balizar isso.\n\nSe quiser tentar, se liga:\n\n1. Durma melhor. Existem inúmeras pesquisas falando sobre os benefícios do sono. Ajuda na perda de peso e regulação dos hormônios que podem diminuir o metabolismo. Tente aumentar as horas de sono de qualidade.\n1. Aumente a ingestão de águe e _CORTE O ÁLCOOL_ (eu não bebo, mas _fica a dica_). Nem preciso falar da importância da água. Mas é algo que não prestamos muita atenção quando estamos de férias. Beba muita água. Principalmente quem quer perder peso, a água vai ajudar a desinchar e diminuir a vontade de doces. Cortar o álcool é complicado, especialmente por causa dos compromissos sociais KKKKKJKK , mas é por um período pequeno e vale a pena.\n1. Diminua a ingestão de carboidratos, se puder corte o açúcar por um tempo. Vai por mim, eu não acredito nessa história de detox mas parar com o açúcar por um período sempre me ajuda a ter mais foco e prestar mais atenção na dieta.\n1. Inclua treinos de força. A musculação deve fazer parte da rotina de qualquer atleta, mas especialmente nessa período de reboot é importante caprichar nos exercícios resistidos para aumentar o metabolismo.\n1. Capriche nos treinos de tiros. Seja correndo, pedalando ou nadando, nesse período gosto de incluir treinos de alta intensidade e curta duração. Esses treinos tb devem fazer parte da rotina de qualquer atleta, mas gosto de aumentar a frequência deles nessa época.\n\nLhe convido em embarcar nessa comigo!",

    "content" : "Se ainda não me conhece empreendi desde 2011 até junho/2019 (durante esse tempo comentei algumas vezes que nunca mais iria empreender) e resolvi voltar para o mercado de trabalho e não é por motivos que quebrei financeiramente, indo na contramão do _hype_ de startups.\n\nAcredito que surgiu diversas perguntas em sua cabeça ao ler o texto acima, acredite que na minha cabeça foram longos meses (quase 1 ano) refletindo sobre o assunto, colocando no papel os prós e contras, imaginando como seria, como me portaria em algumas situações até que por fim resolvi experimentar um ambiente novo, “desconhecido” e acredito que seja desafiador (pelo menos para mim).\n\nRecomenda à leitura desse blogpost Encerrando ciclos, viva no presente não se paralise pelo passado\n\nComo pensava durante alguns anos?\n\nQuando entrei na área de engenharia de software (desenvolvimento, programação) meus colegas de trabalho me auxiliaram criar um pensamento o de que carreira seria uma escada onde começaríamos como desenvolvedor Júnior (baixa experiência e com muita sede de aprender) até um cargo de executivo (muita experiência e perfil de líder, na época não sabia o que era liderar e chamava de chefe), seguindo uma escada mais ou menos assim:\n\n1. Estagiário\n2. Desenvolvedor Júnior\n3. Desenvolvedor Pleno\n4. Desenvolvedor Sênior\n5. Líder técnico\n6. Gerente de desenvolvimento ou projeto\n7. Gerente da área de tecnologia\n8. Diretor da área de tecnologia\n9. Empresario - big boss, esse tópico surgiu depois de alguns anos trabalhando\n\nConforme o tempo vai passando e vamos ganhando experiência na área técnica começamos perceber que não é uma escadinha e podemos nos manter na área técnica ou gestão - vulgo chamada carreira em Y - dependendo do perfil do profissional, onde cada pessoa senta mais familiaridade (gostar).\n\nPara chegar nesse pensamento tive que me desconstruir diversas vezes e conversar com diversas pessoas para entender o que elas pensavam sobre o assunto, até em um discernimento e conseguir discutir sobre assunto.\n\nEm 2018/2019 palestrei bastante sobre a carreira do engenheiro de software, expondo porque existe especialização academia (por exemplo, MBA) e falando sobre essa tal de carreira em Y.\n\nMesmo depois dessa viagem de desconstrução pessoal o meu pensamento sobre se tornar empresario não mudou, ou seja, uma vez empresario sempre empresario e terei que criar outra empresa caso canse do que estou fazendo.\n\nDurante alguns momentos de meditação voltada para meu lado profissional eu comecei refletir sobre esse assunto, até relacionar meu antigo pensamento com a área de desenvolvimento de software e empreender, surgindo turbilhões de questionamentos:\n\n Por que não posso voltar para o mercado caso eu queria?\n Estou quebrado financeiramente para voltar ao mercado?\n Só voltarei para o mercado caso eu quebrei e não consiga recomeçar?\n Uma vez empresario, sempre empresario?\n O que eu gosto de fazer? O que tenho prazer de fazer?\n ...\n\nComo comentado foi um processo longo para conseguir responder algumas perguntas, mergulhando dentro do meu próprio eu e com muita ajuda de terapia, sempre evoluindo pessoalmente um degrau por vez.\n\nDizem que empreender faz ganhar muito dinheiro, mas gastamos igual ou mais com terapia.\n\nVoltei ser funcionário?\n\nSim e não, meu perfil de empreendedor (fazer o projeto/empresa acontecer) é uma característica pessoal minha, onde não quero mudar (acredito que consigo, mas não quero).\n\nHoje ocupo o cargo de head de engenharia no Jusbrasil que é referência no mercado Jurídico Brasileiro, tocando um projeto que tem tudo para revolucionar a forma que os advogados produzem suas peças.\n\nEm 2014 palestrei muito sobre empreendendo dentro da empresa que você trabalha e mesmo assim eu voltei pensar ao contrário da forma que pensava antes.\n\nO cérebro humano é uma máquina que se adapta a qualquer ambiente e adversidade, treine ele para fazer o que você quer e precise fazer, sempre com o foco em longevidade com uma rotina sustentável e saudável para você.\n\nVocê comentou que voltou ser funcionário e respondeu “sim e não”, como assim?\n\nEstou usando todos meus skills de empreendedor que envolve controle de fluxo de caixa, vontade de fazer, liderança de time, gerenciamento de expectativas e muito mais, para tocar o projeto que estou envolvido.\n\n#evolua",

    "content" : "Esporte? O que é isso?\n\n\n\nMeu pai quase foi um jogador de futebol e por ele gostar muito de futebol desde pequeno sempre me incentivou a gostar, mas nunca foi minha cara!\n\nCresci pensando que só existia futebol como esporte e nunca tive curiosidade em nenhum outro tipo de esporte, cá entre nós, por que sair da zona de conforto?\n\nDepois de ganhar muito peso (chegando a 180kg) resolvi começar correr para me desconectar do “dia a dia empreendedor” e durante a corrida pensar em como resolver algum problema que tinha dentro da empresa, porém o tiro saiu pela culatra. Enquanto estava “correndo” (no começo caminhando) não conseguia pensar em nada e esse tempo começou ser importante para mim, era o momento de cuidar da minha saúde mental.\n\nNão sou um corredor rápido, mas o que sempre me chamou atenção na corrida são longas distâncias, principalmente depois que comecei ligar o fato de correr durante muito tempo com luta mental, como mudar minha forma de pensar (mindset) para conseguir correr 10, 15, 21km, ou a distância que você conseguir imaginar? Após a primeira prova de 5km sempre busquei provas com distâncias maiores e sempre lutando contra meu próprio cérebro.\n\nCom o passar do tempo comecei seguir algumas pessoas que julgo correr bem e via que eles praticavam outros esporte também, na real eles praticam triathlon que é composto por 3 modalidades: nadar, pedalar e correr.\n\nNós de tecnologia somos curiosos ao entender como surgiu as coisas, comigo não foi diferente ao olhar para o triathlon, fui buscar como surgiu e acabei achando um esporte lindo, principalmente pela superação de nós mesmos, como faço para passar 12 horas (tem atleta que faz em menos e o limite são 17 horas) em uma prova sem morrer, pô 12 horas é meio-dia, eu reclamava de correr 30 minutos imagina se conseguiria ficar durante 12 horas fazendo uma prova (começar na parte da amanhã e terminar na parte da noite), estou falando de uma prova chamada IRONMAN. Até que por fim comecei treinar para esse negócio e é viciante.\n\nA briga psicológica contra nós mesmo para vencer nossas dores musculares e buscar qual é nosso real limite. Muitas pessoas me perguntam se não sinto:\n\n- dor\n- preguiça\n- vontade de parar, mas sei que é nesse momento que irei me destacar dos outros participantes\n- saudade do que gostava de fazer (balada, festa, trabalhar muito, etc)\n- acordar tarde\n- dormir tarde\n\nLogicamente que sinto dores, para cada sim que damos ele vem repleto de não, ou seja, vou fazer meu primeiro IRONMAN (triathlon, me tornar um homem de ferro), para isso preciso me dedicar aos treinos e focar 100% no que me levará até a prova. Se fui capaz de seguir o treino que o coach (assessoria esportiva) passou para fazer antes da prova, no dia da prova será uma puta diversão seguido de diversos desafios psicológicos e nesse momento devo ser forte para resistir as diversidades com muita resiliência.",

    "content" : "Estou a mais de 1 ano treinando para meu primeiro triathlon (IRONMAN 70.3) e nos últimos 7 meses treinando com time de alta performance que faz triathlon profissionalmente a muitos anos. O ano de 2018 foi um ano de muito aprendizado em uma área que nunca imaginei que entraria, para contextualizar segue o conteúdo abaixo:\n\n\nNovos atletas no time\n\nQuando recebi o convite para fazer parte do time de alta performance (aka senior) eu me vi alguns anos atras entrando no mercado de trabalho como desenvolvedor junior e com muita sede de aprender. Infelizmente não foi tão fácil, eu já vinha treinando por conta propria a alguns meses para o Triathlon (que até então não tinha data), com isso trouxe alguns vícios (por sinal muito errado) para o meu dia a dia de treino com atletas profissionais, venho aprendendo a cada dia que passa a respeitar meus limites, me conhecendo e buscando um pouco mais a cada dia. Nos primeiros dias de treino junto com o time tentei entender ao máximo cada momento do treino, mas era difícil fazer as perguntas certas na hora certa, era tudo muito novo e diferente do que eu estava acostumado treinar, com o passar dos dias eu comecei conseguir fazer algumas perguntas, pois consegui organizar o fluxo de ideias e as dúvidas ficaram mais claras.\n\nNesse time que faço parte é extremamente comum entrar _“novos membros”_, com isso eles tem um processo de onboard bem definido e claro por todos os membros, assim não dependendo só de um membro (o personal training por exemplo) para explicar o que deve ser feito e onde estou errando (julgo o mais importante), assim deixando o feedback em um tempo extremamente curto evitando ao máximo lesões. Como estamos lidando com parte muscular do corpo de uma pessoa que tem que se levar ao limite, qual quer erro não corrigido corretamente trará uma lesão muscular, que em muitos casos levam algumas semanas para se recuperar. Quando acontece lesões em um membro todos os atletas irão _“pagar”_ por esse erro, tendo que diminuir o ritmo para o atleta lesionado se recuperar e conseguir acompanhar novamente o treino. Todos os atletas do time tem objetivos claros e não quer ter impedimento para alcançar seus objetivos, por esse motivo todos os membros se ajuda e corrige uns aos outros.\n\nDeixa eu resumir isso tudo:\n\n Objetivo claro - alta performance em que?\n Disciplina: fazer todos os dias (ser constante), mesmo quando não queremos\n   _não precisa acelerar, basta não parar_\n Pensamento a longo prazo: os grandes saltos vêm vivendo o presente pensando em colher no futuro\n\n> Ninguém segura uma pessoa com foco e motivada\n\n> Passe bom: Te leva a meta  \n> Passe certo: Te leva a e alavanca para aproxima meta\n>\n> _busque fazer passe certo_\n\nCruzando paralelo com time de desenvolvimento de software\n\nApós entender o processo de onboard de novos atletas comecei refletir sobre o onboard de novos membros júniores na área de desenvolvimento, me surgindo alguns questionamentos:\n\n Porque não colocamos os novos desenvolvedores júnior junto com desenvolvedores sênior?\n Quais tarefas passamos para os desenvolvedores júnior quando ele começa?\n Porque não colocamos eles junto em um time que está em todo vapor e sincronizado?\n Como, porque ... diversas perguntas me veio átona\n\nEm meus projetos e empresas eu não colocava desenvolvedores júnior em time que estava entregando achando que ele iria ficar extremamente perdido e coagido por está lidando com desenvolvedores mais experientes onde está com tempo para entregar.\n\nAnalisando agora acho que _sempre_ fiz errado. Se queremos que uma pessoa ganhe skill sem ter que quebrar muito a cabeça (conhecido como “auto de data”), basta colocar essa pessoa para interagir com quem domina o assunto em questão, as pessoas mais experientes ajudará você _cortar_ um enorme caminho. Principalmente em desenvolvimento de software que não é uma ciência exata e experiência conta muito, experiência não é uma coisa que consigamos tirar da cabeça da pessoa X e colocar na pessoa Y, mais podemos diminuir essa barreira quando ambos estão interagindo no dia a dia.\n\nNão basta colocar o desenvolvedor júnior em time que tenha mais experiencia, precisamos ter um processo de onboard bem definido e com todos os membros do time alinhado com o proposito a ser alcançado com novos membros ingressando ao time.",

    "content" : "Já faz alguns anos que sigo em um voo solo, sem trabalhar para uma empresa e sim fazendo a minha empresa acontecer. Em 2018 não foi diferente, sigo com a Nuveo (empresa que trabalha com Inteligência Artificial e Visão Computacional aplicado para automatização de backoffice, fundada em 2015).\nApós alguns anos, foi momento de trazer um Diretor de Tecnologia para fazer parte do trabalho que vinha fazendo, esse momento não é um processo simples, principalmente por ser fundador da empresa e querer sempre o melhor para ela, mas fiz e tenho a certeza que foi o melhor passo tomado para o crescimento e amadurecimento da empresa. Foi um processo intenso de aprendizado pensando no futuro da Nuveo.\n\nRespirando novos ares\n\nAos que não conhece o “Avelino do passado” não sabe que eu tinha 180 kg e que agora estou treinando para meu primeiro triathlon, não vou entra muito nesse tema, tera outros blogposts referente a isso em breve. Quero falar um pouco mais sobre esse tweet:\n\nEssa certeza de querer mudar só veio a tona quando eu tirei um tempo para refletir na minha vida, eu já queria fazer, mas a insegurança não deixava.\n\nMudar a carreira profissional para outra área?\n\nNão estou saindo da área de tecnologia (na real acho que não consigo, pelo menos hoje) e sim levando a sério (profissionalmente) uma responsabilidade de treinar para fazer minha primeira prova de triathlon.\n\nEssa mudança de área me fez “voltar” ser junior e absorver muito conteúdo. Se você quer acelerar seu processo de aprendizado se envolva com profissionais da área que esta estudando, eles lhe ajudara passar por algumas barreiras que você ficaria parado por muito tempo e no final descobriria que é mais simples.\n\nCertamente gerarei conteúdo traçando um paralelo da minha entrada na área do esporte com minha entrada na área de desenvolvimento.\n\nEscrever livro?\n\nComo comentei acima eu era bem grande e encarei o processo de perda de peso a sério e envolvendo esporte como base do processo.\n\n“ […] você deveria escrever um livro sobre seu processo de perca de penso, cara você tinha 180 kg e hoje esta treinando para fazer seu primeiro triathlon (media de 13 horas de prova, onde levara você ao extremo), isso não é normal, puta superação pessoal […] ”\n\nEscutei frases +- assim algumas vezes durante esse ano de 2018 e sempre vinha em minha mente:\n\n- pô, isso que estou fazendo é normal\n- eu escrever um livro?\n- eu não sei escrever\n- eu não sou capaz\n- ... e diversas outras desculpas, mas nunca saía da cabeça e após meu momento de meditação (quando o cérebro esta tranquilo), voltava pensar nisso #WTF #PQ\n\nDurante alguns meses eu vinha rabiscando algumas coisas que acharia importante ter escutado quando tinha 180 kg. Em linhas gerais precisava escutar mais verdades e menos tapinhas nas costas!\n2018 resolvi dar o primeiro passo de querer fazer e encarar como um projeto com começo, meio e fim.\n\nSe tornar atleta?\n\nSinto que estou muito longe de me tornar um atleta, comecei faz poucos anos nessa fase de treinar e profissionalmente tem poucos meses, mas sei que depende apenas de mim para isso se tornar realidade. Vamos deixar os anos dizer se me tornarei atleta ou não, adianto que estou gostando de me superar a cada dia.\n\nHoje tem uma marca financiando meu dia a dia de treino, acredito que só consegui porque estou fazendo por gostar do que estou vivendo e saber aproveitar as oportunidades que vem aparecendo com minha exposição proposital no Instagram, pressão social (se expor publicamente) geralmente funciona para nos cobrar psicologicamente.",

    "content" : "_“Eu não preciso de férias, trabalho com o que eu gosto, é um hobby o que eu faço”_\n\nEu disse isso por alguns anos em minha vida, até tirar férias e perceber que eu também precisava de férias.\n\n\n\nApós ler o blogpost do Raphael Amorim comecei refletir sobre como seria tirar férias e passar alguns dias vivendo para mim e minha família. Não foi um exercício fácil, nunca tinha feito isso na vida, trabalho profissionalmente a 13 anos e não me recordo ter tirado férias de verdade nesse período, sempre estive na corrida dos ratos (termo usado para um exercício sem fim, auto-destrutivo ou inútil).\n\nTrabalhar por hobby\n\nÉ muito comum profissional da área de tecnologia falar que trabalhamos por hobby, será que isso realmente é (100%) verdade ou usamos essa “desculpa” para ressaltar que trabalhamos com o que gostamos? Em todos os trabalhos, projetos (privado e open source) e etc, temos as coisas legais (o que nos motiva continuar), mas temos os “problemas” também.\n\nMuitas vezes nós brasileiros usamos termos em inglês e em ambiente errado, mas qual o significado da palavra hobby?\n\n> Hobby é uma palavra inglesa frequentemente usada na língua portuguesa e significa passatempo, ou seja, uma atividade que é praticada por prazer nos tempos livres.\n\n> Um hobby não é uma ocupação a tempo inteiro, e tem como objetivo o relaxamento do praticante.\n\n> Normalmente, a prática de um hobby não implica vantagem financeira para a pessoa em questão. Apesar disso, ele pode se transformar em uma tarefa que resulta em benefício financeiro para o praticante. Por exemplo, uma pessoa que tem a pintura como um passatempo, pode vender um dos seus quadros.\n\nNão trabalhamos por hobby e sim fazemos o que gostamos, por esse motivo relacionamos o trabalho com hobby, com o passar do tempo dentro de uma empresa começa chegar “problemas” (isso em qual quer empresa, mesmo aquela que você sonha trabalhar) e nesse momento é comum os desenvolvedores quererem mudar de empresa, soando que o desenvolvedor fica pulando de galho em galho.\n\nO _“pular de galho em galho”_ ocorre pela _“busca da felicidade”_, mas será que existe alguma empresa que não teremos “problemas”?\n\nPlanejamento\n\nComo tudo em minha vida eu “tento” planejar (algumas vezes falho miseravelmente, mas em grande maioria tem dado certo), não é um trabalho muito fácil fazer planejamento de alguma coisa que você nunca fez, principalmente quando envolve viajar de carro com a família (tenho um filho de 5 anos) por mais de 1000 km em estrada e locais que não conhece, logicamente que preciso pensar na segurança da minha família.\n\nCom a ajuda da minha esposa, paramos algumas horas durante muitos dias para fazer o planejamento de lugares que queríamos conhecer do Nordeste. A primeira versão foi uma lista gigante, mas fomos colocando alguns filtros até chegar em um roteiro realmente executável mentalmente, mas lógico que não tínhamos ideia que seria tão cansativo (como foi).\n\nO grande trabalho que vejo no começo do planejamento (principalmente com mais de uma pessoa) é ambos conseguir tirar ideias da cabeça e colocar em um “papel” onde todas as pessoas envolvidas consigam ter visibilidade de todas as ideias e artefatos, para aí sim começar o planejamento de fato. É uma viagem em família (mas poderia ser entre amigos) e temos que colocar a vontade de ambos no planejamento.\n\nUsamos alguns apps para nos ajudar no planejamento da viagem, principalmente o trecho que seria percorrido de carro, conhecer locais no destino e local para passar a noite (dormir):\n\n <https://roadtrippers.com/> - planejamento dos trecho percorrido de carro;\n <https://www.booking.com> - locação de local para ficar (evitamos hotel caros pois queríamos uma experiencia real de cada local);\n <https://www.airbnb.com/> - locação de local para ficar;\n <https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/> - conhecer lugares de um destino planejado;\n <https://foursquare.com/> - conhecer lugares de um destino planejado, principalmente locais para comer;\n <https://www.waze.com/> - Navegação de um destino para outro (GPS);\n <https://www.google.com/maps> - Navegação de um destino para outro (GPS) e locais para abastecer o carro;\n <http://wifimagic.com/> - Senha do WiFi.\n\nPor que Nordeste?\n\nÉ um lugar maravilhoso (_é afirmação após ter vivido mais de 20 dias por lá_), mas existe muito conteúdo falando do Nordeste Brasileiro, principalmente fotos mostrando praias exuberantes. Particularmente eu queria um lugar onde tivesse dificuldade de conectividade com internet, era uma premissa que eu coloquei mentalmente (acabei não expondo isso no planejamento para não deixar a esposa preocupada) para dificultar acesso ao trabalho durante os dias que iria tirar para viver minha família e eu mesmo, o tempo para eu pensar no meu futuro, será que já não esta/estava na hora de encerrar algum ciclo na minha vida?\n\nA PythonBrasil\\[14\\] (conferência de Python em 2018) foi em Natal e aproveitamos para juntar a conferência com alguns dias off (férias que julgava não precisar), então tínhamos o ponto inicial de onde “sairíamos”, Natal.\n\nDestinos\n\n 1.

    "content" : "Lidar com software legado hoje em dia é mais comum do que podemos imaginar, costumo dizer que muitos softwares nascem legado, como assim?\nPara mim software que não tem teste automatizado é legado, não tem como garantir funcionamento de absolutamente nada dentro dele e muitos comportamentos (recursos ou bugs) só irá aparecer com usuários usando constantemente.\n\n\n\nApós alinhamento do que é software legado é comum a empresa (principalmente as com cultura de startup) e desenvolvedores ter que trocar peças do software em pleno o voo, não temos como pousar o avião para fazer manutenção e depois decolar novamente quando a empresa está com clientes usando o software em produção.\nCom isso vem o trabalho do engenheiro de software junto com time para fazer planejamento de trocar peças (componentes, módulos pacotes, serviços ou qual seja o nome que você de para isso) do software com ele no ar.\n\nPlanejamento\n\nNo meu ponto de vista esse trabalho deve ser feito com muito planejamento e pé no chão, só assim conseguimos pensar nos possíveis problemas que possamos ter, mas tenha em mente que não terá como prever todos os possíveis problemas, mesmo passando meses e meses planejando, a única certeza que podemos ter é: ao colocar no ar surgirá imprevistos, bem-vindo a vida de desenvolvimento de software.\n\nEsse é o momento de alinhamento do “problema” e possíveis soluções junto com o time envolvido, tenha certeza que todos os envolvidos entendeu o problema antes de dar o próximo passo de sair vomitando soluções e consequentemente escolher a melhor solução. Se um dos membros não entendeu o problema não deve ignorar, ele não enxergou como um possível problema ou o trabalho de expor o problema não foi claro para todos, essa deve ser a hora de praticar a comunicação entre os membros do time, geralmente não é um trabalho fácil, mantenha sempre a calma, seja objetivo e traga o time de volta ao tema quando começar sair, para mim não existe nível hierárquico para fazer isso, todos devem estar com o mesmo propósito: resolver o “problema”.\n\nEm software usamos um termo chamado baby step (passos de bebê), ou seja, dê o próximo passo após concluir o atual (um de cada vez).\n\nChegando à solução\n\nPara qualquer “problema” existem diversas soluções e isso não é diferente no mundo de software. Lidando com software legado (contexto desse blogpost) temos que ter o equilíbrio do melhor software e da solução que resolve o que estamos buscando resolver.\nDesenvolvedores geralmente quer partir para melhorar software ao nível de software, mas precisamos pesar isso com outras métricas para ver qual é a melhor solução realmente:\n\n Tempo\n Esforço\n Conhecimento (do time, esse é extremamente importante)\n\nMinha escolha sempre será por uma solução que o time consiga dar manutenção e mais de uma pessoa já usou a abordagem sugerida em produção - existe um abismo enorme entre teoria e produção (infelizmente).\n\nEsse é o momento de exercitar o conhecimento do time para escolher qual caminho seguir:\n\n Micro Serviço (REST, RPC ...)\n Fila de processamento\n Serverless\n Serverless + API Gateway\n Módulo, pacote, biblioteca e/ou ...\n ...\n\nComo tudo em minha vida, tento ter mais de uma opção caso a primeira escolhida não funcione, trago essa abordagem para desenvolvimento de software também - mas já tive casos que todas as possíveis soluções não funcional e infelizmente foi momento de jogar a toalha e repensar no negócio, via software estava impossível resolver.\n\nReescrevendo as peças\n\nDado que o time escolheu a melhor solução para o “problema” é momento colocar à teoria discutida em prática, pode ser que a primeira solução não seja possível, estava implícito algum ponto que não tinha visibilidade antes começar, infelizmente em alguns casos (e não por falta de experiência) isso acontece, principalmente quando estamos falando de software legado. Gosto da analogia cavar um buraco na areia, existem diversas ferramentas que pode “adivinhar” o que tem onde vamos cavar, mas se realmente funcionasse 100% (algumas pode chegar muito próximo desse número) não precisaríamos de arquivologista ou outras profissões seguindo essa área de atuação.\n\nDeploy, grande momento de ir para produção\n\nMesmo tudo funcionando extremamente bem em ambiente de teste, homologação ou qualquer nome que você dê, a tendência de ter imprevistos quando colocarmos o software em produção é grande, esteja preparado para ter que lidar com eles.\n\nAlgumas coisas que tento evitar (sempre que possível):\n\n Certifique-se se realmente tudo foi escritório teste e de fato testado por todos envolvidos nos outros ambientes;\n Deploy de sexta, ninguém do time está afim de perder o final de semana em família e/ou suas obrigações pessoais. Mas tem casos que não temos como esperar, planejamento é à alma desse ponto;\n Caso apareça problema evite ser o super-herói e se tranque ao seu mundo para resolver o problema e volte com a “bala de prata”;\n Caso apareça problema evite hacking no servidor de produção, tenha um plano de roll back (voltar para versão anterior) caso necessário;\n Na linha do roll back, mantenha os logs gerados no momento do crash. No calor do momento é sempre um problema lembra desse pequeno/grande detalhe;\n\nDeixe algumas recomendações nos comentários para o pessoal que ler esse blogpost após você.",

    "content" : "Beginning of any project (especially when we are talking about open source) is extremely entertaining for developer, over the years the fun passes and it is the responsibility to keep your son following the path of it.\n\n\n\n\nHow did the starting awesome-go?\n\nAll projects I started are out of necessity, the awesome-go was no different.\n\nAfter knowing the awesome-python and seeing other awesomes projects I searched for the awesome-go and did not get results. Wanted to do a simple project where he had markdown code with a list of legal projects written in go, this in Jul 6, 2014 with the commit start environment Awesome for Go\n\nAfter many people help the project began to have access and receive contributions. That was the moment I realized I would have to write code to help revise the contributions (dubbed as pull request within GitHub). Maintainers have written test to validate the following patterns within the markdown:\n\n Test alphabetical order\n Test if exist duplicated links\n Test if an entry has description, it must be separated from link with  - \n\nWork that was done manually by the maintainers and the volume of contributions was virtually impossible to revise all.\n\n\nWhat big challenge of maintaining an open source project?\n\nThere are several, but I will talk about what I currently find most complicated (involves very very dedication).\nI always thought the big challenge of keeping project open source would be to write code, but for many years I believe it was wrong. Today I see that the biggest challenge of maintaining project is to create community, train new leaders, write documentation for new contributors understand and to be new covers join the project.\n\nThe awesome-go is no different from other open source projects, just contribute, interact, engage and etc, which will have your space. From now on, I welcome you to the project.\nInterested in contributing, recommends reading:\n\n Contribution Guidelines\n Code of Conduct\n\n\nTop Contributors and Fork Members, these are the contributors (and maintainers) of the project, they that make the awesome-go be busy until today. Here is my heartfelt thanks to all involved.\n\n\nWhat's the focus the project today?\n\nThe focus has not changed (it is the same), we are a list of go packages, categorized and maintained by the community.\n\nLast year I sent e-mail to some current maintainers go language team proposing to move the repository to golang organization to be managed by the core team, after a few email exchanges they responded to me with some problems if the awesome-go was maintained by the golang organization. In a brief summary the awesome-go would go from a list of packages (maintained by the community) to a list of official packages approved by the core team, and that not purpose of the project.\n\n\nWhat's the future of the project?\n\nAs all open source projects the focus is to grow community maintainer, thus bringing new ideas (and diversity) to improve each day the list of packages and agility in reviewing the contributions.\n\nWe need to improve the visibility of the site awesome-go.com on Google (SEO), for this we need people with new ideas and willingness to contribute.\n\nAll the idea to improve the life of the awesome-go project will be very welcome!\n\nStay inside:\n\n Open contributions\n* Problems and/or suggestions",

    "content" : "Após ler alguns blogpost sobre usar o iPad como computador principal e conversar com um amigo que trabalha no Google que usa em caso como main laptop, resolvi estudar os apps para iOS que eu teria que usar para atender a minha demanda do dia a dia como gestor e desenvolvedor.\n\nComo sempre a Apple faz um ótimo trabalho nos seus produtos, sempre pensando na simplicidade de uso do seu cliente final, ou seja, isso ajuda o onboard em qualquer dispositivo/software deles. Nem tudo são flores, ao deixar algumas coisas muito óbvias acaba confundindo (no começo) quem vem da experiência de usar um laptop para um iPad, mas acredita que em alguns dias (no meu caso 1 semana) já estava extremamente acostumado com o meu ambiente e clicando com o dele como não houvesse amanhã!\n\nMas é possível desenvolver usando o iPad?\n\nBom vamos lá, deixa eu contextualizar como era meu ambiente de desenvolvimento antes de responder essa pergunta.\n\nEu usava um Macbook de 12’ com a seguinte configuração:\nProcessador: i7\nMemoria: 16GB RAM\nDisco: 512GB ssd\nCor: Ouro Rose (por escolha própria, muitos me questionava pela cor dele, mas eu simplesmente gostei, até o atendente da Apple perguntou se seria para a minha esposa 😕)\nEra um super avião em poder de processamento e extremamente portátil, mas nem tudo é era tão bom como esperado, algumas coisas previstas, mas outras não. Um USB-C, acabei-me acostumando, pois usava a dock station DELL WD15 quando estava em casa para ligar monitor externo (HDMI ou VGA), ethernet, USBs e etc, o problema que vejo é a tela quando estou na rua (fora do home office), ela é meia “mole”, isso acontecia em um MacBook Air 11’ que tive no passado, acredito que isso seja uma feature não bug para Apple.\n\nCom essa máquina eu sempre mantive o meu ambiente de desenvolvimento remoto, isso mesmo, tudo em um servidor conectando via mosh (ssh com menos buffer, leia mais sobre aqui MOSH), a anos não uso IDE para desenvolver software passando com alguns editores que roda em console (sem interface gráfica), VIM durante muitos anos (eis que surgiu o vim-bootstrap) e hoje EMACS (acredito que isso seja assunto para outro blogpost kkkkk).\n\n Dia a dia de desenvolvimento é entorno das seguintes tecnologias:\n\n- Go\n- Python\n- Clojure (quando preciso rodar alguma coisa em JVM)\n- TypeScript (quando preciso mexer em forntend, mas tento correr disso sempre que posso, sorry)\n- Rum (brinquedo que ultimamente não estou com tempo de brincar 😞)\n\nOlhando as tecnologias acima é possível se virar bem sem interface gráfica, Clojure dando um pouco mais de trabalho por causa da JVM (build dá um pouco de trabalho, IDE existe click build 😋), mas é possível.\n\nAgora respondendo a pergunta “é possível desenvolver usando o iPad?\nPara a minha necessidade atual sim, lógico que levou um tempo (julgo anos) até conseguir viver sem uma interface gráfica para desenvolver, hoje eu consigo me virar super bem.\n\n\nPorque escolher o iPad como computador principal?\n\nEscolha pelo iOS como ambiente principal foi após olhar se todos os aplicativos que eu precisava seria possível ter no iPad. O meu dia a dia estava mais em ferramentas office que desenvolvimento de software.\nSou CTO da Nuveo (empresa que trabalha com Inteligência artificial) e o meu dia estava se resumindo em reuniões (texto que foi dito dentro da reunião), detalhamento de história para o time técnico transformar em software, criação de diagrama (forma de expressar ideia em fluxo), desenvolvimento de software (ssh/mosh) e responder muitos emails. Não consigo ficar tão longe de desenvolvimento de software, como leu no tópico anterior eu mantinha o meu ambiente de desenvolvimento remoto, isso tornou (100%) viável a minha ida para um iPad Pro.\n\n\n- Reunião: Existem muitos apps para anotações e muitos deles dá suporte a iPencil (caneta da Apple);\n- Criação de diagrama: iPad, combinado com a iPencil e Apps que existem para esse fim a atividade de criação de diagrama fica extremamente dinâmica e fluida;\n- Desenvolvimento (ssh): Tem algumas clientes ótimos para ssh e mosh, onde não deixa a desejar para openssh cliente em laptop;\n- Ferramentas office (responder email): iOS está muito bem servido para ferramentas de escritório iWorks (Number, Pages, Keynote e etc) e Office 365 (Microsoft Office), cliente de email existem muitos (alguns extremamente completo), cloud store (Dropbox, Google Drive e iCloud).\n\n\nAcessórios\n\nExistem diversos acessórios que ajuda a auxilia no uso diário do iPad, segue abaixo a lista de acessórios que eu usava:\n\n- Smart Keyboard: olhando por vídeo e imagem pensava que seria horrível digitar com ele, sinceramente me surpreendeu e muito, está muito longe para ser o melhor teclado, mas é relativamente confortável digitar\n- iPencil: nunca usei outra “caneta” para iPad ou outro device, na minha opinião é excepcional após aprender manipular ela (no começo fiquei meio perdido)\n- Adaptador Lightning HDMI (monitor externo)\n- Logitech Create Backlit Keyboard Case (substitui pelo Smart Keyboard, não achei muito portátil para carregar, fica muito grande)\n\nExistem muitos acessórios para deixar o iPad mais laptop.\n\n\nApps?\n\n- Blink: Cliente mosh e ssh (super recomendo)\n- SSH Tunnel: Criar tunnel ssh (proxy)\n- OpenVPN: Cliente para VPN\n- 1Password: Não consigo viver sem ele hoje em dia 😄\n- MIHTool: Developer Tools do Browser\n- Safari: Poderia usar o Chrome, mas no iOS não liberar trocar o browser padrão (acredito que isso irá se manter até eles levar um processo)\n- Airmail: Cliente de email\n- ProtonMail: Cliente de email pessoal (criptografado)\n- PivotalTracker: Gestão de tarefa usada na Nuveo\n- Dropbox: O meu “File System”, dado que o iOS não libera acesso no FS do iOS\n- Documents by Readdle: Conecta em diversos Cloud Store\n- Editorial: Editor de markdown (texto) com sync no Dropbox\n- Notability: Editor com suporte a iPencil\n- Telegram: Comunicação pessoal\n- Slack: Ferramenta de chat usado para comunicação interna na Nuveo\n- Lucidchart: Ferramenta de diagrama\n- MindMeister: Ferramenta de mind manager\n- appear.in: Vídeo conferência\n- Google Meet: Vídeo conferência\n- Skype: Vídeo conferência\n- MUDRammer — Cliente MUD (game via telnet)\n\nAcredito que eram esses apps que usava no dia a dia.\n\n\nPara qual uso eu recomendo o iPad?\n\nEsse é um assunto extremamente complicado dado que o iPad Pro não é um hardware barato e sim um hardware de “luxo”.\nPara quem quer um hardware para navegar na internet e utilizar ferramentas offices acredito que seja uma escolha ideal (se não entrarmos em relação do valor).\n\n\nContinuo usando o iPad?\n\nCostumo dizer que ter um iPad Pro é um ambiente de luxo, consegue viver sem ele, mas tenha certeza que como qualquer ferramenta boa ganha dependência extremamente fácil e rápido.\nPassei 2 meses usando diariamente o iPad para todo o tipo de trabalho até ir em cliente onde tive que passar o dia desenvolvendo (via 4G, o cliente não tinha WIFI liberado para terceiro).\nUm dos motivos claros que me fez deixar o uso do iPad (vendi 😞) foi a falta do trackpad (achei extremamente triste isso), acostumei viver clicando na tela, mas particularmente não é para qualquer momento, mouse ainda é mais prático — pelo menos para mim — para o meu filho de 5 anos tenho certeza que ele prefere clicar na tela. “Uso do iPad no colo”, não é muito confortável usar o iPad no colo com o Smart Keyboard (nem Logitech Create Backlit), é possível não pratico.\n\nSinceramente acredito que fiz uma escolha errada, usava uma laptop de 12’ (extremamente portátil) e comprei o iPad Pro de 12.9’ (maior que meu laptop), essa escolha me fez voltar para laptop.\n\nHoje estou usando MacBook Pro de 13 com TouchBar (não consegui acostumar com ele ainda 😞), praticamente o mesmo tamanho e peso do meu iPad Pro de 12.9 com case/keyboard. Sinto falta da praticidade de expressar coisas com iPencil, mas é possível viver sem.\n\n\nAmbiente de desenvolvimento\n\nComo comentei eu conecto em servidor remoto, ou seja, uso Debian Sid e instalo tudo que preciso lá, assim nada fica local na iPad e/ou laptop.\n\n\nOutros blogposts\n\n\nRecomendo ler esse blogpost: Conheça seu ambiente de trabalho",

    "content" : "É extremamente comum ver amigos que começam a contribuir com open source quererem arrumar um “emprego” para passar o dia contribuindo com o projeto (em geral, deixando o Github verdinho...). Será que é realmente legal, como muitos imaginam, trabalhar para uma empresa para só contribuir com open source?\n\n\n\nCostumo dizer que contribuir com open source é viciante, faz você passar horas e horas entendendo o projeto que alguém (ou alguma empresa) idealizou, até que chega o momento de mandar o primeiro PR (pull request, patch e etc) e defender sua implementação. Vem a aí a primeira skill que o desenvolvedor (você) precisa evoluir (caso ainda não tenha). Sim estou falando de venda. Não venda de produto e sim da sua ideia (aprender a se comunicar via texto - em geral em inglês) Está aí outro problema, pois texto não passa sentimento. Hoje acho bom, principalmente pensando em uma contribuição, pensar na evolução do software e não levar só o que acreditamos para dentro do software (se você mantém um software open source, esteja aberto às novas ideias/necessidades).\n\nEm um primeiro momento sim, mas como qualquer sonho nem tudo é previsível (principalmente quando você nunca ocupou essa posição antes). A ideia de escrever esse blogpost é expor um cenário que provavelmente você não analisou. Quando estamos apaixonados achamos que o caminho a percorrer é composto de flores.\n\n\nVamos direto ao ponto!\n\nQuando você contribui com qualquer projeto (principalmente open source), dedica algumas horas (dias, meses e até mesmo anos) do seu tempo para entendê-lo e após compreendê-lo, existem duas linhas a seguir:\n\n- - Propor/implementar alguma necessidade que você tem;\n- - Assumir alguma issue proposta por alguém.\n\nOu seja, a escolha (autonomia) está em suas mãos. Esse é o ponto no qual eu quero chegar: autonomia.\n\nMas quando eu estiver dentro de uma empresa será igual?\nEntão, bem provavelmente não. Sabe por quê? Porque você está sendo pago para implementar as necessidades que a empresa tem e não as suas necessidades!\nSe você chegou até esse ponto, isso pode piorar, principalmente se você estiver contribuindo com um grande projeto open source.\n\nJá pensou que a empresa em que você trabalha pode necessitar de um recurso que você não concorda em ter no projeto? E você terá que defender uma ideia que não concorda, pois está sendo pago para isso? Esse é um ponto que muitas pessoas que querem ser pagas para contribuir com open source não pensam e te desafio a pensar o que você faria quando passasse por este cenário (caso queira ocupar uma posição desse tipo).\n\n- O que você faria?\n\nTenha em mente que nada é para sempre e amanhã você pode estar em outra empresa, mas a pessoa que defendeu/propôs/lutou/se expôs (use a palavra que se encaixa no seu mundo) o recurso X, Y e Z foi você e não a empresa que te pagava!\n\nEntão não devo aceitar trabalho para contribuir com open source?\n\nAcredito que surgiu a seguinte duvida: Durante quase todo o texto parece que você (Avelino) apoia o fato de que a pessoa deve fazer aquilo que ela está sendo paga para fazer, mas no último parágrafo parece que você (Avelino) muda de ideia e traz a mensagem de que é o indivíduo que contribui e não a empresa e que deve-se ter cuidado.\n\nNão existe certo ou errado, estou escrevendo esse blogpost para fazer você refletir que ser pago para contribuir com open source pode não ser tão divertido como muitos pensam. Minha dica seria você evoluir os seguintes skills:\n\n- - Venda: não necessariamente vender um produto e sim sua ideia;\n- - Comunicação: nem todos irão abraçar sua ideia (isso é bom não é ruim);\n- - Aprenda a dizer não: costumo dizer que o aprender dizer não vem com a senioridade. Nesse contexto a palavra não expõem que você não concorda com alguma coisa proposta, não que você é contra a pessoa, ou seja, não é uma negação a pessoa e sim ao contexto (nesse caso proposta) a ser seguida;\n- - Aprenda a debater idéias, não convicções;\n- - Aprenda a ouvir: extremamente importante.\n\nPor último e julgo o mais importante você ter ciência é: Open Source é mantido por pessoas\n\nLição aprendida na PythonBrasil[13]",

Que tal essa enquete abaixo!\n\n\n\nAVISO: Estou expondo minha opinião pessoal (recomendo considerar como loucura da minha cabeça)\n\nAnalisando o resultado da enquete fica extremamente claro que o medo de muitos é o fracasso, não é nada fácil combater esse medo (mas é necessário para uma evolução pessoal), uma das formas de combater qualquer medo é encarar ele de frente, isso não quer dizer que você não tem medo e sim que esta batendo de frente com você mesmo.\n\nLendo a história de muitos atletas de alta performance muitos tem medo de não conseguir, mas com muito treino (onde geram dores, lesões e etc) o medo de não conseguir passa pois você se preparou para o momento que lhe gera medo. Qual a diferença disso para nossa vida? Nenhuma, tudo é questão de treino, persistência e muita meditação (alinhamento de pensamento).\n\nMedo de empreender?\n\nEmpreender é uma vida de ansiedade e baixa visão (mesmo quando sua empresa esta indo muito bem), ou seja, isso gera uma ansiedade extremamente grande e consequentemente medos.\n\nNa real não é um medo de empreender e sim responsabilidade com todos os colaboradores da empresa.\n\n- E se o cliente não fechar\n- E se o dinheiro acabar\n- E se não funcionar a solução proposta\n- E se não vender\n- E se não acontecer como estamos planejando (essa pode ter certeza que não ira contracena, mas planejamento é importante para minimizar o risco kkkkk)\n- E se ...\n- E se ...\n- E se ...\n\nSe for pensar em todos e se você não sai do lugar e não dá o próximo passo, ou seja, acabará não fazendo. Tenha em mente que só a idea de fazer não irá mudar sua história, agora a ação/execução (o fazer) tem valor e lhe ajudará derrubar o medo do fracasso.\n\nCostumo dizer: Prefiro pedir desculpa por ter feito errado do que pedir desculpa por não fazer, ser proativo lhe ajudará perder o medo.\n\nDê o primeiro passo\n\nMinha dica para todos que tem algum medo é dar o primeiro que os outro passos acontecem naturalmente.\nFaça, execute, saia da zona de conforto e encare de frente seus medos.\n\nEscrever esse quote não foi fácil mas julgo importante todos saber que mesmo por trás de um cara durão (não sei se tão durão assim kkkk) que sempre julgou (mostrou) não ter medo em alguns passos da minha vida eu tive/tenho medo mas faço e controlo minha ansiedade até o resultado chegar.\n\nUm passo de cada vez nos faz alcançar nosso resultado almejado.",

    "content" : "Tradução do blogpost Style guideline for Go packages escrito pela @rakyll.\n\n\n\nCódigo organizado em Go é fácil de entender, usar e ler. A falta de organização em código Go é tão crítica quanto as APIs mal projetadas. Os diretórios, nome e a estrutura dos seus pacotes são os primeiros elementos com os quais os utilizadores vêem e interagem.\n\nO objetivo deste blogpost é ajudá-lo(a) com boas práticas comuns para não definir regras ruins. Você deve sempre usar o seu julgamento para escolher a solução mais elegante para sua implementação.\n\n\nPacotes\n\nTodos os códigos Go são organizados em pacotes. Pacote em Go é simplesmente um diretório (pasta) com um ou mais arquivos .go dentro dele. Pacotes Go fornecem isolamento e organização de código semelhante a diretórios e organização de arquivos em um computador.\n\nTodo o código Go vive em um pacote e um pacote é o ponto de entrada para acessar o código Go. Compreender e estabelecer boas práticas em torno de pacotes é importante para escrever um bom pacote (código) Go.\n\n\nOrganização do pacote\n\nVamos começar com sugestões de como você deve organizar código Go e explicar convenções sobre o nome de pacotes Go.\n\nUsar vários arquivos\n\nPacote é um diretório com um ou mais arquivos Go. Sinta-se livre para separar seu código em quantos arquivos achar melhor para a legibilidade ideal.\n\nPor exemplo, o pacote HTTP pode ter sido separado em arquivos diferentes de acordo com o aspecto de handles HTTP. No exemplo a seguir, o pacote HTTP é dividido em alguns arquivos: tipos do cabeçalho e código, tipos de cookie e código, a implementação HTTP real e a documentação do pacote.\n\n``markdown\n- doc.go       // documentação do pacote\n- headers.go   // HTTP tipos de headers e código\n- cookies.go   // HTTP tipos de cookies e código\n- http.go      // HTTP implementação do cliente, request e tipo de response, etc.\n`\n\nManter os tipos próximos\n\nComo regra geral, mantenha os tipos mais próximos de onde eles são usados. Isso tornará mais fácil qualquer contribuição e manutenção (para você ou outra pessoa externa) para encontrar um tipo. Um bom lugar para as estruturas de dados (struct) pode estar no começo do arquivo headers.go.\n\n`bash\n$ cat headers.go\npackage http\n\n// Header represents an HTTP header.\ntype Header struct {...}\n`\n\nA linguagem Go não restrige onde você deve definir os tipos, uma boa prática é manter os tipos na parte superior do arquivo, dentro do pacote que ele faz parte.\n\nOrganização por responsabilidade\n\nUma prática comum de outras linguagens é organizar tipos juntos em um pacote chamado modelos (ou algum nome nessa linha). Em Go, nós organizamos o código por suas responsabilidades funcionais.\n\n`go\npackage models // DON'T DO IT!!!\n\n// User represents a user in the system.\ntype User struct {...}\n`\n\nEm vez de criar um pacote chamado modelos e declarar todos os tipos de entidade lá, um tipo de usuário deve viver em um pacote de camada de serviço.\n\n`go\npackage mngtservice\n\n// User represents a user in the system.\ntype User struct {...}\n\nfunc UsersByQuery(ctx context.Context, q Query) ([]User, Iterator, error)\n\nfunc UserIDByEmail(ctx context.Context, email string) (int64, error)\n`\n\nPensando no godoc\n\nNão é muito facil pensar (usar) Godoc na fase inicial do desenvolvimento da API do seu pacote para ver como seus conceitos serão renderizados no doc. Muitas vezes, essa visualização tem um impacto sobre o projeto (em geral para melhor). Godoc é a forma como os usuários vão consumir um pacote, por isso é extremamente importante ajustar as coisas para torná-las mais acessíveis, tenha certeza que isso melhora a API dos seus pacotes.\n\nExemplos para preencher as lacunas\n\nEm alguns casos, talvez não seja possível fornecer todos os tipos relacionados de um único pacote. Pode ser confuso fazer isso (em uma fase inicial), você pode querer publicar implementações concretas de uma interface comum de pacote separado ou esses tipos podem ser propriedade de um pacote de terceiros. Dê exemplos para ajudar o usuário a descobrir e entender como eles são usados juntos.\n\n`bash\n$ godoc cloud.google.com/go/datastore\nfunc NewClient(ctx context.Context, projectID string, opts ...option.ClientOption) (Client, error)\n...\n`\n\nNewClient trabalha com option.ClientOptions mas não é nem o pacote de armazenamento de informações nem o pacote de opção que exporta todos os tipos de opção.\n\n`bash\n$ godoc google.golang.org/extraoption\nfunc WithCustomValue(v string) option.ClientOption\n...\n`\n\nCaso a API do seu pacote exija que muitos pacotes não padrão sejam importados, é útil adicionar um exemplo Go para mostrar aos usuários código de exemplo.\n\nExemplos é uma ótima maneira de aumentar a visibilidade de um pacote menos descoberto. Por exemplo, para datastore.NewClient pode referenciar o pacote de opção extra.\n\nNão exportar de main\n\nUm identificador pode ser exportado para permitir o acesso a ele de outro pacote.\n\nOs pacotes principais não são importáveis, portanto, exportar identificadores de pacotes principais é desnecessário. Não exporte identificadores de um pacote principal se você estiver construindo o pacote para um binário.\n\nExceções a esta regra podem ser os principais pacotes incorporados um .so, .a ou Go plugin. Em tais casos, código Go pode ser usado a partir de outras linguagens através da funcionalidade exportar CGO e identificadores de exportação são necessários.\n\n\nNome do pacote\n\nO nome do pacote e caminho de importação são ambos identificadores significativos do seu pacote e representam tudo o que o seu pacote contém. Nomear seus pacotes canônicamente melhora não apenas sua qualidade de código, mas principalmente para os usuários do pacote que você esta criando/mantendo.\n\nSomente em minúsculas (lowercase)\n\nOs nomes dos pacotes devem ser minúsculos. Não use snake_case ou camelCase em nomes de pacote. O Go blog tem um guia abrangente sobre nomear pacotes com uma boa variedade de exemplos.\n\nNomes curtos, mas representativos\n\nOs nomes dos pacotes devem ser curtos, mas devem ser exclusivos e representativos. Os usuários do pacote devem ser capazes de entender sua finalidade a partir do nome, sem necessidade de ler documentação (esse trabalho não é nada fácil, mas é possível).\n\nEvite nomes de pacotes demasiado amplos como common e util.\n\n`go\nimport pkgs.org/common // DON'T!!!\n`\n\nEvite nomes duplicados em casos que o usuário precise importar o mesmo pacote.\n\nSe você não pode evitar um nome ruim, é muito provável que haja um problema com sua estrutura geral e organização de código, esse é um grande alerta para repensar do design da sua API.\n\nClaro caminho de importação\n\nEvite expor sua estrutura personalizada de repositório aos usuários. Alinhe bem com as convenções GOPATH. Evite ter src/, pkg/ e etc, no caminho da importação.\n\n`go\ngithub.com/user/repo/src/httputil   // DON'T DO IT, AVOID SRC!!\n\ngithub.com/user/repo/gosrc/httputil // DON'T DO IT, AVOID GOSRC!!\n`\n\nSem plural\n\nEm Go, os nomes dos pacotes não são plurais. Isso é surpreendente para os programadores que vieram de outras linguagens e estão retendo um velho hábito de pluralização de nomes. Não use nome do pacote httputils, mas httputil!\n\n`go\npackage httputils  // DON'T DO IT, USE SINGULAR FORM!!\n`\n\nRenomear deve seguir as mesmas regras\n\nSe você estiver importando mais de um pacote com o mesmo nome, poderá renomear localmente os nomes dos pacotes. Os renomes devem seguir as mesmas regras mencionadas neste blogpost. Não há nenhuma regra sobre que pacote que você deve renomear. Se você está renomeando a biblioteca de pacotes padrão, é bom adicionar um prefixo Go para fazer o nome de auto documento que é Go biblioteca padrão pacote, por exemplo, gourl, goioutil.\n\n`go\nimport (\n\tgourl net/url\n\n\tmyother.com/url\n)\n`\n\nURLs personalizada (vaidade)\n\ngo get suporta a obtenção de pacotes por uma URL que seja diferente da URL do repositório do pacote. Estas URLs são chamadas de URLs personalizadas e exigem que você sirva uma página com meta tags específicas que as ferramentas Go reconhecem. Você pode servir um pacote com um domínio personalizado e um caminho usando URLs personalizadas.\n\nPor exemplo:\n\n`bash\n$ go get cloud.google.com/go/datastore\n`\n\nverifica o código-fonte de https://code.googlesource.com/gocloud bastidores e colocá-lo em seu espaço de trabalho (GOPATH) $GOPATH/src/cloud.google.com/go/datastore.\n\nDado code.googlesource.com/gocloud já está servindo este pacote, seria possível ir buscar o pacote a partir desse URL? A resposta é não, se você impor a URL personalizada.\n\nPara fazer isso, adicione uma instrução import ao pacote. A ferramenta Go rejeitará qualquer importação deste pacote de qualquer outro caminho e exibirá um erro amigável para o usuário. Se você não impor as suas URLs personalizadas, haverá duas cópias do seu pacote que não podem trabalhar em conjunto devido ao namespace diferente.\n\n`go\npackage datastore // import cloud.google.com/go/datastore\n`\n\n\nDocumentação de pacote\n\nDocumente sempre seu pacote. A documentação do pacote é um comentário de nível superior imediatamente anterior à cláusula package. Para pacotes não-principais, godoc sempre começa com Package {PkgName} e segue com uma descrição. Para pacotes principais, a documentação deve explicar o binário.\n\n`go\n// Package ioutil implements some I/O utility functions.\npackage ioutil\n\n// Command gops lists all the processes running on your system.\npackage main\n\n// Sample helloworld demonstrates how to use x.\npackage main\n`\n\nUse doc.go\n\nÀs vezes, os docs do pacote podem ser longos, especialmente quando fornecem detalhes do uso e das diretrizes. Quando isso acontecer mova o pacote godoc para um arquivo doc.go`. (consulte um exemplo de um doc.go.)",

    "content" : "Como começou minha paixão por parênteses (ops Lisp)?\n\nTenho uma formação na área de Matemática Aplicada (começa ai a loucura), Lisp foi uma das poucas linguagens de programação que me deparei dentro da academia (eu já programava em Perl profissionalmente e conhecia Python), quando vi aqueles parênteses de cara pensei isso não é para mim (isso é uma loucura de Matemática/Acadêmico que nunca saiu para o mercado de trabalho). Com o passar das aulas eu comecei achar confortável os parênteses (seres humanos acostuma muito rápido com tudo) e comecei achar estranho a forma de pensar para escrever a lógica do software (por exemplo (+ 1 2)). Lisp usa Notação polonesa como forma de expressão, isso foi complicado acostumar, no dia a dia usava uma linguagem de programação normal e dentro da academia funcional (sem saber que era funcional).\n\nCom o tempo comecei pegar gosto pela forma de pensar (funcionalmente) e acabei entrando para um projeto (no mercado, não académico) que usava Common Lisp na sua implementação SBCL (Steel Bank Common Lisp, que é mantido até hoje). Nesse momento eu virei super fã da linguagem e com a forma de lidar com software (de verdade) em produção. A empresa trabalhava com dados estatístico do mercado de Pesquisa Cliníca e LISP foi tomado como linguagem por matemáticos, isso facilitou muito a comunicação entre o time de engenharia e acadêmicos.\n\nComo tudo começou?\n\nÉ um conjunto de linguagem de programação especificada pelo John McCarthy em 1955 saindo sua primeira versão em 1958 (durante um projeto de pesquisa em inteligência artificial) influenciado pelo seu aluno Alonzo Church. A motivação de McCarthy surgiu da idéia de desenvolver uma linguagem algébrica para processamento de listas para trabalho em IA (inteligência artificial). O seu nome vem de LISt Processing (a lista é a estrutura de dados fundamental desta linguagem). Tanto os dados como o programa são representados como listas, o que permite que a linguagem manipule o código fonte como qualquer outro tipo de dados.\n\nNascendo assim o Lisp 1, a versão que realmente foi distribuída por McCarthy e outros do MIT (Massachussets Institute of Tecnology) foi Lisp 1.5 (manual de programadores), assim chamada porque continha várias melhorias no interpretador Lisp 1 original, mas não foi uma grande reestruturação como planejado que fosse ser o Lisp 2.\n\nLinha do tempo de linguagens que segue o dialeto Lisp\n\nVou começar apartir do Lisp 1.5 pois foi o primeiro a ser distribuido.\n\n- Lisp 1.5 (1955 - 1965)/Dialeto - Primeira implementação distribuída por McCarthy e outros do MIT\n- Maclisp (1965 - 1985)/Dialeto - Desenvolvido pelo MIT Project MAC (não relacionado Apple, nem ligado com McCarthy)\n- Interlisp (1970 - 1990)/Dialeto - Desenvolvido pela BBN Tecnologiapara PDP-10 rodando no sistema operacional Tenex, logo após adotado pela máquina Xerox Lisp o InterLisp-D\n- ZetaLisp (1975 - 1995)/Dialeto - denominada Lisp Machine - usado nas máquinas Lisp, descendente direto de Maclisp.

    "content" : "Aprender novas tecnologias (nesse caso linguagens de programação) não é um trabalho fácil, vai muito além de conhecer syntax da linguagem. Exige alguns desafios como entender porque a linguagem foi criada (existe), entender o eco sistema, como fazer deploy, como gerenciar ambiente de produção e etc.\n\n\n\nPensando nessa introdução vou falar um pouco sobre conhecer o seu ambiente de trabalho antes de conhecer novas tecnologias (linguagens), é muito comum ver desenvolvedores querer usar sempre o que existe de mais novo no mercado (linguagem, framework, plugin, editor e etc) sem pensar no time de desenvolvimento envolvido, mas sera que isso realmente é a melhor coisa a se fazer para empresa que você trabalha? O nível de complexidade são diferente para pessoas, é extremamente comum ver um desenvolvedor (geralmente auto de data) aprender novas tecnologias muito rápido, mas nem todos são assim. Um dos trabalhos de ser CTO é saber dosar a dose do remédio para que todos os desenvolvedores esteja sempre na mesma página, isso envolve dizer alguns não momentâneos (não é fácil esse papel, mas é extremamente necessário).\n\nConhecer seu editor\n\nÉ primordial você conhecer o editor que você trabalha, não adianta você querer usar o editor que esta em hype para a tecnologia X, use o que você realmente sabe usar. Principalmente na área de desenvolvimento de software muitos desenvolvedores fala de Emacs e Vim, você realmente precisa usar esses editores? Minha opinião é que você conheça, pois é importante conhece como outros desenvolvedores trabalha, mas leve isso como um novo caso de estudo não leve em paralelo com o estudo sobre a tecnologia que esta aprendendo, tenha foco no que você quer aprender, tempos tempo para aprender muita coisa na vida, basta ter paciência, perseverança e foco nos objetivos.\n\nPontos importantes para você conhecer do seu editor:\n- Teclas de atalhos: com o passar do tempo você percebe que seu dia começa ficar mais produtivo quando começa largar a dependência do mouse;\n- Uso de busca em código (não se prenda dentro do editor, conheça como fazer usando bash também);\n- Trabalhar com mais de um projeto na mesma janela do Editor (Hoje é extremamente comum dividir o que é frontend e backend, trabalhar com micros serviço e etc, com esse cenário sera necessário você se adaptar em trabalhar com mais de um projeto aberto pois você precisa implementar e/ou corrigir código em mais de um projeto), as maioria dos editores de hoje em dia lhe da suporte a isso, fique tranquilo;\n- Conhecer configuração do seu editor, como colocar um plugin novo, como configurar uma linguagem nova e etc.\n\n> Usei durante muitos anos TextMate até me dedicar a aprender VIM (sim, parei de estudar durante 6 mês outras tecnologias e me voltei para o estudo do VIM), isso me fez aprender muito mas é uma escolha, o que você quer aprender? X ou Y? Depois de anos usando VIM resolvi aprender usar Emacs e já estou a 2 anos usando ele como editor principal, ou seja, mudamos de opniões e temos disponibilidade de conhecer coisas novas.\n\nFormas de debugar seu software\n\nSaber uma linguagem de programação nova não basta saber a syntax e sim quais ferramentas ela lhe traz para debugar o software que esta desenvolvendo, seja print, breakpoint, gdb, pdb ou qual quer outra forma. Como desenvolvedor é extremamente importante software ser capaz de achar bugs dentro do software que você esta desenvolvendo ou dando manutenção (desenvolvido por outro desenvolvedor), se você não estudar a fundo como debugar software na sua linguagem você tera alguns problemas para achar o bug que seu software pode ter.\n\nLogs, ambiente de produção precisa ser rastreável\n\nAntes de falar de logs você precisa ter em mente as principais diferença de log e print.\n\nConhecer uma linguagem de programação nova é necessário saber como ela se comporta em produção (falando mais uma vez, não é só saber syntax), logar eventos do seu software é extremamente importante, colocar cor para identificar evento é muito importante para você não perder horas tendo que analisar um log, ou até mesmo jogar os logs coletados fora pois esta impossível de se fazer analise (infelizmente já vi mais de uma vez isso acontecendo).\n\n\nPratique (treine)\n\nTodos atleta de alta performance precisa praticar (exaustivamente) para ficar bom o suficiente para assim competir. Em desenvolvimento de software não é diferente, você precisa praticar para conseguir desenvolver software sem ficar pensando qual a teclada de atalho no meu editor mesmo?, qual o nome daquele pacote que faz XYZ mesmo? e etc. Se você tiver que ficar pensando nessas coisas como seu cérebro tem espaço pra saber qual o problema que você tem que resolver, pensar na melhor maneira da sua arquitetura? Não tem como pensar nessas coisas pois seu cérebro está concentrado em entender seu eco sistema e não resolver o problema, por isso devemos ter o eco sistema em nossa mente para ai sim depois pensar na solução do problema.\nQuanto melhor você conhecer suas ferramentas melhor você será como desenvolvedor. Uma forma que eu faço para praticar é contribuir com projetos open source, desenvolver não é apenas escrever código e contribuição open source envolve mais relacionamento humana (remoto que é mais difícil ainda) do que código.\n\n> Se você não é bom em falar com pessoal é importante aprender by JavaMan\n\n\nConsiderações finais\n\nEntenda seu ambiente de trabalho, você precisa dominar seu eco sistema para performar mais no seu dia a dia, deixe ele tão simples para o seu cérebro para você não precisar pensar mais nele. Trabalhe com uma tecnologia que lhe deixe feliz e faça com ela o que você realmente precisa fazer, não se engane buscando desculpas dentro de si mesmo para lhe justificar o que esta fazendo (aprendendo X ou Y). Mantenha seu foco em estudos que lhe traz evolução profissional e/ou pessoal.",

    "content" : "Antes de entrar no assunto do titulo vou contextualizar o porque estou escrevendo esse blogpost.\n\nEu (Avelino) a anos acompanho minha rede de contato no LinkedIn e via que muitas pessoas estava como (ou se tornou à pouco tempo) CEO (Chief Executive Officer, que significa Diretor Executivo) de empresa, isso me surgiu curiosidade em saber qual empresa essas pessoas tinham se tornado CEO, para minha surpresa a maioria tinha se tornado CEO de uma empresa e continuava trabalhando em outra empresa, muitas sendo assalariado.\n\nCom isso surgiu algumas dúvidas dentro da minha cabeça:\n\n- Como ser Diretor Executivo de uma empresa e ocupar um cargo em outra empresa?\n- “Como ter tempo para ser Diretor Executivo e ocupar um cargo em outra empresa?\n- Como fazer relacionamento com sociedade, acionistas, sócios, funcionários, clientes, governo e etc?\n\nAnalisando esse comportamento eu acho que seria interessante compartilhar meu pensamento sobre o falso glamour de empreender e ser CEO.\n\n\nO que é CEO e qual seu papel?\n\nCEO é a sigla para Chief Executive Officer, que significa Diretor Executivo. É o cargo de mais alto nível a ser ocupado em uma companhia, o responsável pelo gerenciamento de toda a organização.\n\nO seu papel é, além de aplicar as decisões na prática ser aquele que lidera as discussões, promove novas maneiras de pensar e que é o comunicador por excelência de uma organização. É também sua função trabalhar a relação com a imprensa e com tudo que envolva a companhia, mas que aconteça fora dela.\n\nO CEO, no entanto, não tem passe livre (você acha que vai colocar o seu salário de R$ 70.00,00 por ser CEO?) para fazer o que quiser. Ele executa as decisões, mas responde diretamente ao conjunto de diretores da empresa. Na maior parte das companhias, existe um diretor que supervisiona o trabalho do CEO (pensando em grandes companhia), a quem o executivo normalmente se dirige preferencialmente.\n\n\nGlamour\n\nGlamour tem sua origem na palavra Grammar, e significa uma qualidade extraordinária em um determinado indivíduo, fazendo com que ele pareça muito atraente.\n\n\n\nTrazendo o termo Glamour para dentro do contexto do blogpost, estamos falando de uma pessoa que tem qualidade extraordinária de se relacionar com sociedade, acionistas, sócios, funcionários, clientes, governo e etc, qual quer pessoa é apta a ter esse perfil? Respondendo esse questionamento eu diria que Sim, mas precisa de experiência e isso só vem com o tempo.\n\n\nMeu caso em particular\n\nPara quem não me conhece sou CTO (e fundador) da Nuveo (nuvem inteligente que revolucionará a forma como as pessoas guardam, utilizam e encontram informações) fundada em 2015. Após passar por uma crise em uma das empresas que eu tinha resolvi tirar algumas semana para pensar como sair do buraco que estava, depois de alguns dias pensando como resolver os problemas financeiros (mas nunca pensando a curto prazo e sim a logo prazo) cheguei na ideia base da Nuveo.\n\nEu sei que não tenho (e não quero ter) perfil para ser CEO de uma companhia, dado esse cenário liguei para o atual CEO da Nuveo (José Flavio Pereira) comentando a ideia e como imaginaria monetizar (lógico que essa ideia mudou depois de alguns meses pois percebemos que não era possível tracionar no mercado e muito menos escalar), Flavio me pediu alguns minutos para pensar e iria me retornar a ligação. Aproximadamente 30 minutos depois, ele me retorna com duas pessoas querendo investir na empresa (que nem tinha nascido), ou seja, eu tinha achado o CEO da Nuveo (bastava ele aceitar), logicamente ele aceitou e segue na empreitada até hoje.\n\n\nResponda para você mesmo\n\n\n\n- O que adiantaria assumir o cargo de CEO sendo que não tenho perfil?\n- Ou você quer viver de aparencia em ser chamado de CEO?\n- O que lhe motiva continuar empreendendo?\n- Quantas vezes você já pensou em desistir?\n\n\nEmpreender é viver no risco, precisamos minimizar ao máximo nosso risco.",

    "content" : "Para quem não me conhece eu tive uma startup durante um tempo e ela foi comprada por uma empresa de fora do Brasil. Logo após a venda da startup eu prometi para mim mesmo que nunca mais empreenderia, sim isso foi um comentário que fiz em um dos meus momentos de reflexão e nunca comentei com ninguém até então.\n\nPorque eu prometi isso para mim?\n\nEmpreender não é um processo simples, não existe mar de rosas no caminho do empreendedor e como tudo temos altas e baixas (e por sinal mais baixa do que alta).\nEu fui sócio do Christiano Anderson durante um tempo e ele foi e ainda é uma inspiração para mim como desenvolvedor e empreendedor, passava horas e horas tomando cerveja com ele entendendo algumas tomadas de decisão na vida dele e isso me fez ter ele como uma referência (e por sinal uma ótima referência).\nVoltando ao motivo, antes de vender à startup meu filho tinha nascido e empreender com uma criança recém-nascida foi um processo complicado, esposa precisando de atenção (mais do que o comum) e eu tendo que desenvolver solução para melhor atender os clientes, nessa fase logicamente que foi uma fase de baixa (poucos clientes). Como em muitos casos não tínhamos planejado ter filho, mas que venha com saúde.\n\n\nÁ volta para o mercado de trabalho!\n\nQuando voltei para o mercado de trabalho queria ter estabilidade dentro da empresa e com isso aceitei algumas condições de trabalho não muito favorável (mas condições que muitas pessoas que mora em São Paulo – Capital aceita), eu andava media de 42 km para ate o escritório, sim 84 km por dia dentro de uma máquina de 4 rodas (chamada carro) e fazia papel de gerente de projeto (para quem não sabe eu tinha certificado PMP, que venceu em 2014 e não tenho a mínima vontade de renovar). Meu dia a dia era mandar e-mail e dar prazo para projeto, sei que isso na área de tecnologia não é muito fácil (mas é o que tem para hoje).\nChegava em casa extremamente cansado por ter trabalhado o dia todo e consequentemente ter participado do trânsito de uma megalópole (em São Paulo, você não pega transito e sim participa, é muitas horas para falar que pegou transito).\nLogicamente que não fiquei muito tempo nessa vida e resolvi procurar outra oportunidade e fui trabalhar home office (remoto) como desenvolvedor. Agora sim cheguei onde eu quero, trabalhando de casa, vendo meu filho crescer, ate ir para PythonBrasil[10] e passar algumas horas conversando com o Henrique Basto que me fez algumas perguntas que o Renzo e Bruno Rocha tinha feito a 1 ano atrás e eu ainda não sabia responder.\n\n\nA volta para os empreendedorismos…\n\nPorque você trabalha para os outros ainda? Você não consegue viver da renda do samba (site de conteúdo adulto, link para +18)?\n\nIsso fez eu refletir alguns meses e juntar com uma grande vontade que tinha que era sair da Capital e ir morar no interior. Após convence a esposa foi hora de procurar cidade e casa. Lembrei do Cadu que tinha comentado e convidado de eu de vir morar no Vale do Paraíba quando estava trabalhando remoto. Escolhi uma cidade tranquila próximo de SJC para morar com minha família (Caçapava, e viva a Taiada).\n\nSim vamos viver de samba, após 1 mês morando no Vale e empreendendo, o samba me fez sambar, a empresa que mantinha o fluxo do caixa do samba resolveu aplicar algumas regras, que fez o samba não consegui sacar o dinheiro que estava rendendo, sem eu pensar estava novamente empreendendo.\n\nApós isso acontecer, comecei pensar que tinha feito a pior escolha da minha vida em ter saído da Capital e vindo morar no Vale, eu não tinha ligado o nome Vale do Paraíba com Vale do Silício. Sim o Vale do Paraíba respira empreendedorismo, principalmente dentro do Parque Tecnológico de SJC. Onde fez eu retomar meu espírito empreendedor e começa novamente empreender.\n\nHoje posso afirma que empreender é viver novas experiências todos os dias e tirar energia de onde você meno espera.\n\nDevo muito (mas muito) ao Cadu e Nando por algumas horas de bate papo sobre como eles fazem as coisas acontecer dentro da ZNC e experiência de vida empreendedora.",

    "content" : "Ontem na parte da noite conversando com um conhecido ele falou que estava usando em um projeto o Celery, como ainda não conhecia vamos estudar este projeto. Gostei da forma que ele trabalha e como ele integra com o Django. | Tenho em um projeto uma fila de processamento só que foi desenvolvido por mim e não tem todos os recursos que o Celery tem.\n\nVou explicar como usar o Celery com o Django em um exemplo simples, e como sempre basta usar a criatividade para desenvolver a sua necessidade.\n\nPrimeiramente temos que instalar dois pacotes Python para que possamos trabalhar com o Celery no Django, o django-celery e ghettoq. Caso tenhamos o easy_install instalado basta instalar os pacotes da seguinte forma:\n\n``shell\neasy_install django-celery\neasy_install ghettoq\n`\n\nCaso não tenha o easy_install precisamos instalar:\n\n`shell\ncd /usr/src/\ngit clone http://github.com/ask/django-celery.git\ncd django-celery\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py install\ncd ..\ngit clone http://github.com/ask/ghettoq\ncd ghettoq\npython setup.py build\npython setup.py install\n`\n\nApós instalar vamos criar um projeto para que possamos trabalhar com o Celery nele.\n\n`shell\ndjango-admin.py startproject celerytest\ncd celerytest\n`\n\nVamos editar o settings.py:\n\n`python\nDATABASES = {\n    'default': {\n        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n        'NAME': 'test',\n    }\n}\n...\nCARROT_BACKEND = ghettoq.taproot.Database\nINSTALLED_APPS = (\n    ...\n    'djcelery',\n    'ghettoq',\n)\n`\n\nApós declarar qual biblioteca o projeto em Django vai carregar podemos sincronizar o nosso database:\n\n`shell\npython manage.py syncdb\n`\n\nTemos que criar um arquivo chamado tasks.py, esse arquivo trabalha como o models de uma aplicação:\n\n`python\nfrom celery.task.schedules import crontab\nfrom celery.decorators import periodic_task\n\nthis will run every minute, see http://celeryproject.org/docs/reference/celery.task.schedules.html#celery.task.schedules.crontab\n@periodic_task(run_every=crontab(hour=, minute=, day_of_week=*))\ndef test():\n    print Tarefa de teste...\n`\n\nAgora temos que dar start em nosso daemon Celery:\n\n`shell\npython manage.py celeryd -v 2 -B -s celery -E -l INFO\n2010-10-19 05:34:44,215: WARNING/MainProcess] celery@program-8 v2.1.1 is starting.\n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,216: WARNING/MainProcess] /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/celery-2.1.1-py2.6.egg/celery/apps/\n    worker.py:105: UserWarning: Running celeryd with superuser privileges is not encouraged!\n  Running celeryd with superuser privileges is not encouraged!)\n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,216: WARNING/MainProcess] /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/celery-2.1.1-py2.6.egg/celery/apps/\n    worker.py:108: UserWarning: Using settings.DEBUG leads to a memory leak, never use this setting in a production environment!\n  warnings.warn(Using settings.DEBUG leads to a memory leak, \n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,222: WARNING/MainProcess]\nConfiguration -&gt;\n    . broker -&gt; ghettoq.taproot.Database://guest@localhost/\n    . queues -&gt;\n        . celery -&gt; exchange:celery (direct) binding:celery\n    . concurrency -&gt; 2\n    . loader -&gt; djcelery.loaders.DjangoLoader\n    . logfile -&gt; [stderr]@INFO\n    . events -&gt; ON\n    . beat -&gt; ON\n    . tasks -&gt;\n . celerytest.lol.tasks.test\n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,238: INFO/PoolWorker-2] child process calling self.run()\n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,239: INFO/PoolWorker-3] child process calling self.run()\n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,241: WARNING/MainProcess] celery@program-8 has started.\n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,241: INFO/Beat] child process calling self.run()\n[2010-10-19 05:34:44,241: INFO/Beat] Celerybeat: Starting...\n[2010-10-19 05:35:00,537: INFO/MainProcess] Got task from broker: celerytest.lol.tasks.test[22d15af7-8fe9-4acd-bdde-06265004eb50]\n[2010-10-19 05:35:00,760: WARNING/PoolWorker-3] firing test task\n[2010-10-19 05:35:01,088: INFO/MainProcess] Task celerytest.lol.tasks.test[22d15af7-8fe9-4acd-bdde-06265004eb50] processed: None\n``\n\nPronto ele esta rodando.\n\nO Celery é um projeto muito bom só que ainda estamos enfrentando alguns bugs com processos pesado o pior que ele para de processar e não esta dando nem um retorno, por isso antes colocar em produção teste sua aplicação onde o Celery vai rodar.",

To join the Church of Vim, you need only pronounce the Confession of the Faith:\n\n    There is no system but GNU, and Linux is one of its kernels.\n\nSainthood in the Church of Vim requires living a life of purity-but in the Church of Vim, this does not require celibacy (a sigh of relief is heard). Being holy in our church means exorcizing whatever evil, proprietary operating systems have possessed computers that are under your control, or set up for your regular use; installing a holy (i.e., wholly) free operating system (GNU/Linux is a good choice); and using and installing only free software with and on the system. Note that tablets and mobile phones are computers and this vow includes them.\n\nJoin the Church of Vim, and you too can be a saint!\n\n People sometimes ask if St IGNUcius is wearing an old computer disk platter. That is no computer disk, that is my halo — but it was a disk platter in a former life. No information is available about what kind of computer it came from or what data was stored on it. However, you can rest assured that no non-free software is readable from it today.\n\nIn addition to saints, the Church of Vim also has a hymn - the Free Software Song. (No gods yet, though.) Hear the song sung by Saint IGNUcius himself.\n\nSome of the early epistles of the Church of Vim were collected years ago before the establishment of sainthood.\n\nSaint IGNUcius says: Some people don't realize that Saint IGNUcius is Saint IGNUcius's way of not taking himself too seriously. Therefore,\n\n    Warning: taking the Church of Vim (or any church) too seriously may be hazardous to your health.\n\n\nInspired by St IGNUcius",

    "content" : "Nós da área de tecnologia passamos muito por encerramento de ciclos, resolvi escrever um blogpost não técnico para retratar alguns pontos importantes na hora de fecharmos nossos ciclos. Não estou escrevendo uma ciência exata, acho extremamente importante após ler o blogpost você pare para pensar o que acha certo ou errado, e sinta-se livre para comentar.\n\nSempre é preciso saber quando uma etapa chega ao final. Se insistirmos em permanecer nela mais do que o tempo necessário, perdemos a alegria e o sentido das outras etapas que precisamos viver. Encerrando ciclos, fechando portas, terminando capítulos - não importa o nome que damos, o que importa é deixar no passado os momentos da vida que já se acabaram.\n\n- Foi despedido do trabalho? Terminou uma relação?\n- Deixou a casa dos pais? Partiu para viver em outro país?\n- A amizade tão longamente cultivada desapareceu sem explicações?\n\nVocê pode passar muito tempo se perguntando por que isso aconteceu. Pode dizer para si mesmo que não dará mais um passo enquanto não entender as razões que levaram certas coisas, que eram tão importantes e sólidas em sua vida, serem subitamente transformadas em pó. Mas tal atitude será um desgaste imenso para todos: seus pais, seu marido ou sua esposa, seus amigos, seus filhos, sua irmã, todos estarão encerrando capítulos, virando a folha, seguindo adiante, e todos sofrerão ao ver que você está parado.\n\nNinguém pode estar ao mesmo tempo no presente e no passado, nem mesmo quando tentamos entender as coisas que acontecem conosco. O que passou não voltará: não podemos ser eternamente meninos, adolescentes tardios, filhos que se sentem culpados ou rancorosos com os pais, amantes que revivem noite e dia uma ligação com quem já foi embora e não tem a menor intenção de voltar.\n\nAs coisas passam, e o melhor que fazemos é deixar que elas realmente possam ir embora. Por isso é tão importante (por mais doloroso que seja!) destruir recordações, mudar de casa, dar muitas coisas para orfanatos, vender ou doar os livros que tem. Tudo neste mundo visível é uma manifestação do mundo invisível, do que está acontecendo em nosso coração - e o desfazer-se de certas lembranças significa também abrir espaço para que outras tomem o seu lugar.\n\nDeixar ir embora. Soltar. Desprender-se.\nNinguém está jogando nesta vida com cartas marcadas, portanto às vezes ganhamos, e às vezes perdemos. Não espere que devolvam algo, não espere que reconheçam seu esforço, que descubram seu gênio, que entendam seu amor. Pare de ligar sua televisão emocional e assistir sempre ao mesmo programa, que mostra como você sofreu com determinada perda: isso o estará apenas envenenando, e nada mais.\n\nNão há nada mais perigoso que rompimentos amorosos que não são aceitos, promessas de emprego que não têm data marcada para começar, decisões que sempre são adiadas em nome do “momento ideal”. Antes de começar um capítulo novo, é preciso terminar o antigo: diga a si mesmo que o que passou, jamais voltará.\n\nLembre-se de que houve uma época em que podia viver sem aquilo, sem aquela pessoa - nada é insubstituível, um hábito não é uma necessidade. Pode parecer óbvio, pode mesmo ser difícil, mas é muito importante. Encerrando ciclos. Não por causa do orgulho, por incapacidade, ou por soberba, mas porque simplesmente aquilo já não se encaixa mais na sua vida. Feche a porta, mude o disco, limpe a casa, sacuda a poeira. Deixe de ser quem era, e se transforme em quem é.",

    "content" : "This blogpost is based in a lecture I presented here in Brazil, follows the slides!\n\n\n\nBottle is a micro web framework compatible with WSGI, depends only on the Python standard library is compatible with python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4, single source file. It was created by Marcel Hellkamp (@defnull) and maintained by the community that raised surrounding framework.\n\nDjango is a framework for rapid development for web, written in Python, which uses the standard MTV (model-template-view) and pragmatic. Was originally created as a system to manage a journalistic site in the city of Lawrence, Kansas. Became an open source project and was published under a BSD license in 2005. The name Django was inspired by the jazz musician Django Reinhardt. Django became very known for having included batteries, i.e. several distributed libraries join the Centre of the framework for simplicity work (called full stack).\n\nPragmatic is what contains practical, realistic considerations, with well-defined target. Be pragmatic is to be practical is to have goals defined. In other words, the team that developed the Django take some description of architecture and who uses Django follows this architecture without being able to change easily.\n\nIt's good a web framework have batteries included? Depends, if you use everything that the framework gives you Yes, but not all web designs are the same.\n\nMany project does not use 80% than Django offers, in those cases that don't use more than 50% of what we pay the cost of offering Django someone have defined the architecture, i.e. lost in performance because the Django has many modules that will not be using and yet he will climb a few modules that we don't use. When we use a micro framework we do the role of architect of application development, since we don't have a set before architecture begins to develop is necessary to devote time to define the architecture of the application.\n\nAll the packages that we have on the Django Python library that can substitute for use in a micro framework!\n\n ORM - SQLAlchemy to bottle-sqlalchemy\n Forms - WTForms\n Template Engine - Jinja2, mako, etc\n Migration - Alembic\n\n\nSQLAlchemy\n\nThe SQLAlchemy exists before Django (yes before Django) and since 2005 we have a team focuses on development of an ORM, unlike Django it's a time to take care of a web framework + ORM (I believe I don't need to talk to a developer focused render more than a developer not focused).\n\nStructure of a model:\n\n``python\nclass Entity(Base):\n    __tablename__ = 'entity'\n    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('id_seq'), primary_key=True)\n    name = Column(String(50))\n\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return <Entity('%d', '%s')> % (self.id, self.name)\n`\n\n\nWTForms\n\nA workaround for those who do not use Django and need to work with forms we have the WTForms, was created in 2008 and maintained until today!\n\nStructure of a form:\n\n`python\nclass UserForm(Form):\n    name = TextField(validators=[DataRequired(), Length(max=100)])\n    email = TextField(validators=[DataRequired(), Length(max=255)])\n`\n\n\nTemplate Engine\n\nJinja2 is a modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Django’s templates. It is fast, widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment\n\n\nStructure of a template:\n\n`html\n<title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>\n<ul>\n{% for user in users %}\n  <li><a href={{ user.url }}>{{ user.username }}</a></li>\n{% endfor %}\n</ul>\n`\n\nMigration\n\nUsage of Alembic starts with creation of the Migration Environment. This is a directory of scripts that is specific to a particular application. The migration environment is created just once, and is then maintained along with the application’s source code itself.\n\n\nStructure of a migration:\n\n`python\nrevision = '1975ea83b712'\ndown_revision = None\n\nfrom alembic import op\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n\ndef upgrade():\n    pass\n\ndef downgrade():\n    pass\n`\n\nHow to make the evolution and downgrade:\n\n`python\ndef upgrade():\n    op.create_table(\n        'account',\n        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer, primary_key=True),\n        sa.Column('name', sa.String(50), nullable=False),\n        sa.Column('description', sa.Unicode(200)),\n    )\n\ndef downgrade():\n    op.drop_table('account')\n`\n\nStructure of a alter table:\n\n`python\n\n$ alembic revision -m Add a column\n\n\nrevision = 'ae1027a6acf'\ndown_revision = '1975ea83b712'\n\nfrom alembic import op\nimport sqlalchemy as sa\n\ndef upgrade():\n    op.add_column('account', sa.Column('last_transaction_date', sa.DateTime))\n\ndef downgrade():\n    op.drop_column('account', 'last_transaction_date')\n``\n\n\nConclusion\n\nExactly what you see, everything that Django has found out the stack of Django. I didn't write this blogpost to speak ill of Django and Yes to shows that exist other solutions for full development stack. Many people use Django by not understanding the environment with Python, today the Django brings much ready that makes some developers get lazy and not gain skills of software architecture.\n\nCome help with the Bottle, we are a growing community, to contribute with code of Bottle look at the issue that we have open. In case of doubt we have mailing list and IRC channel.\n\nGET INVOLVED",

    "content" : "I was wondering how performant Golang is, so I decided to put together a little benchmarking example for myself.\n\nThe benchmark will be done in my personal computer:\n\n\n``\nProcessor  3 GHz Intel Core i7\nMemory  8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3\nSoftware  OS X 10.9.2 (13C64)\n`\n\n\n\n\nSo I started with Python, which is what I know best and created the following simple script;\n\n{{< gist avelino b66dfb057504c4ad93452d037e1ed5c1 factorial.py >}}\n\nThe reason for the total output, was to have a check to ensure that I was getting the same results in each of the scripts. To make sure that they are doing the same amount of work.\n\nRunning the script gives us the following execution time;\n\n\n`\n$ time python factorial.py\n\ntotal: 591400000\n\n0.68s user\n0.01s system\n99% cpu\n0.688 total\n`\n\n\nSo I am getting about 1s in total execution time. Not bad.\n\nNow the same code sample in C, to see what the time execution would be;\n\n{{< gist avelino f2ccbba0573dbbf80dbc1cf955d49b7d factorial.c >}}\n\nCompile and execute the above snippet of code;\n\n\n`\n$ gcc factorial.c -o factorial\n$ time ./factorial\n\ntotal: 591400000\n\n0.01s user\n0.00s system\n91% cpu\n0.016 total\n`\n\n\nOk, that's quite an improvement. This is C, so we do expect there to be a great improvement.\n\nFinally we create our code sample in Go;\n\n{{< gist avelino 2266fc463ac021af99cb85664f2627b1 factorial.go >}}\n\nThen build and run the code sample and we get the following;\n\n\n`\n$ go build factorial.go\n$ time ./factorial\n\ntotal:  591400000\n\n0.01s user\n0.00s system\n93% cpu\n0.018 total\n``\n\n\nSo, that's pretty much the same as C, which is excellent. The best part of it all, is that it is actually fun to code in Go compared to C. Python was always an attraction for me as the language is a breeze to work with and enjoyable programming with it. Go is also a nice language to work with and it's really fast to boot. So I'm very excited about the language.",

Esse final de semana\nestava almoçando com outros desenvolvedores e um deles foi no evento InterCon\nonde um palestrante estava apresentando um case de um video de no máximo 1\nminuto onde esse 1 minuto envolvia no minimo 5 profissionais e a produtora\nlevou media de 5 mês para desenvolver esse projeto.\n\nDesenvolvimento de software não é diferente das área relatada acima, é uma\nárea intelectual onde você precisa pensar como o software escalar, se o banco\nde dados relacional vai se sair bem na hora que tiver muito trafego (caso não,\nqual é a melhor alternativa), qual é melhor design pattern para a\nimplementação a ser feita e outros pontos que envolvem o desenvolvimento de\nsoftware.\n\nEntão aprendam a primeira e mais difícil verdade do mundo: Software\nnormalmente não é resolvido com Software, é resolvido com capacidades\nHumanas. Numa distribuição de Paretto eu diria que 80% de todo problema de\nsoftware somente é resolvido quando você investe aqueles 20% restantes em\nComunicação, Articulação, Pensamento Claro e Racional, quebra Ambiguidades,\nNegociação, Compromisso.\n\nQuando você passa um prazo (faz uma promessa) você vai ter que assumir o\nrisco que a proposta inicial vai realmente resolver o problema proposto, e\nisso nem sempre é possível pois estamos trabalhando com tecnologia e a\nevolução é constando. Outra que nos engenheiro de software não somos\nmaquinas onde usamos software para escrever software e sim uma cabeça\npensante de onde sai toda a logica.\n\nDito isso, é possível cumprir todas as promessas? Não, infelizmente não é.\nMas é nossa responsabilidade como profissionais estar sempre em busca desse\nideal, não criar maneiras de evitá-las.\n\nOu seja, não existe uma ciência exata para prazo!",

    "content" : "Durante 5 anos usei o sistema operacional da Apple (OS X), o OS X é um ótimo sistema operacional principalmente o ambiente gráfico que é sensassional, sistema de áudio entre outros recursos, os 3 primeiro anos usei sem problema nem um ate que a Apple veio com uma historia de cobrar pelo Xcode (The Xcode interface seamlessly integrates code editing, UI design with Interface Builder, testing, and debugging, all within a single window. The embedded Apple LLVM compiler underlines coding mistakes as you type, and is even smart enough to fix the problems for you automatically), ou seja, é a IDE para escrever projetos para plataforma Apple (OS X e iOS) mais o compilador vugo GCC, essa foi a gota d'agua, eles estavam vendendo o GCC, mas como eu já tinha me acostumado com o ambiente (que não é um trabalho muito complicado pois a Apple faz ótimos produtos) não quiz parar de usar e comprei o Xcode, depois de um tempo a Apple voltou a traz colocando novamente de graça.\n\nDepois dessa dramática historia acima comecei olhar valores de notebook (e ultrabook) a tentativa de parar de usar OS X, logo após olhar valores fica pensando, acho que não vou conseguir voltar usar Linux como estação de trabalho novamente pois vou sentir falta dos aplicativos Apple e deixei a ideia para lá, e nisso se passou mais 1 ano.\n\nAte que parei para refletir o que eu usava do OS X, segue abaixo a lista de aplicativos:\n\n iTerm2\n vim (via linha de comando)\n Python\n ssh\n PostgreSQL\n Chrome (e diversos serviços web)\n\nOu seja, tudo que eu usava e acha que iria sentir falta eu conseguiria rodar em Linux. Logo depois dessa reflexão eu lembrei que tinha ganhado um CR-48 (Chromebook) do Google e resolvi começa brinca com ele para ver como era à experiência, apesar da maquina não ser potente como o Macbook Retina (i7) que eu usava estava atendendo minha necessidade, a primeira vista é um notebook que tem apenas um Chrome e com isso todos os serviços web funciona perfeitamente. Olhando o Chrome OS mais de perto vi que é um Linux (baseado em Gentoo) ao meu ver o Google fez um ótimo trabalho principalmente no ambiente X (mais para frente escrevo um blog post falando sobre o que achei do Chrome OS).\n\nDepois desse lero lero todo, achei uma distribuição Linux que atendia minha necessidade ( browser e console para desenvolver), para quem não sabe é possível instalar Linux via chroot dentro de uma pasta no Chrome OS.\n\nEis que resolvi compra o Chromebook Pixel, que por sinal tem uma hardware ótimo para trabalhar com Chrome OS.\n\n\n\nEstou trabalhando a uma semana no Chrome OS e ate agora não tive necessidade de pegar o Macbook para nada, ou seja, voltei usar Linux e agora posso dizer novamente que não uso nem um software propietario no meu notebook. Tudo que achei que iria sentir falta do ambiente Apple era nada mais nada menos que coisa da minha cabeça.\n\nEstou de volta ao desktop livre.",

    "content" : "Esse ano de 2012 ajudei a comunidade Riak que a cada dia esse banco de dados vem me surpreendendo. Estou para escrever um blogpost desde fevereiro, mas como vida de programador (pelo menos para mim esse ano) é agitada.\n\nResolvi falar sobre a performance nesse primeiro blogpost sobre Riak e colocar na mesa um teste (relativamente simples) para compara o tempo de inserção, realmente é um teste simples se tratando de NoSQL.\n\nAntes de mostrar a comparação acho importante deixar claro as vantagens que temos em utilizar Riak:\n\n- Disponibilidade: sistema de recuperação de dados onde trabalha de forma inteligente para que esteja disponível para ler e escrever operações, mesmo em ambiente com falha, assim garantindo a integridade dos dados;\n- Tolerância a falhas: pode perder o acesso aos nós (Servidores Riak), devido à falha de rede ou partição de hardware e nunca perder de dados;\n- Simplicidade de utilização: facil adição de máquinas em um cluster Riak, sem ocorrer uma carga nos servidores - isso em um pequeno grupo de servidores como uma grande quantidade de servidores Riak;\n- Escalabilidade: Riak distribui automaticamente os dados ao redor do cluster e produz um aumento de desempenho quase linear quando você adicionar dados.\n\nDepois de deixar claro os itens acima podemos colocar na messa o Riak e o grande MongoDB, lembrando que esse blogpost não é para falar qual NoSQL é melhor ou para você parar de utilizar um ou outro banco, Riak e MongoDB tem algumas características semelhantes, esse foi o motivo de colocar em teste os dois.\n\nO teste foi simples preciso inserir 1 milhão (1000000) de registro no meu banco de dados, qual banco de dados entrega isso mais rápido para mim?\n\nCódigo Python usando drive nativo do Riak:\n\n``python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n-- coding: utf-8 --\n\nimport riak\n\n\n\nclient = riak.RiakClient()\nbucket = client.bucket('test')\n\nfor i in range(0, 1000000):\n    person = bucket.new('riak_developer_%d' % i, data={'name': 'Thiago Avelino %d' % i,\n                                                       'age': 18+i,\n                                                       'language': ['python'],})\n`\n\nCódigo Python usando drive nativo do MongoDB:\n\n`python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n-- coding: utf-8 --\n\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n\n\nconnection = MongoClient()\ndb = connection.test\npersons = db.persons\n\nfor i in range(0, 1000000):\n    person = persons.insert({'name': 'Thiago Avelino %d' % i,\n                             'age': 18+i,\n                             'language': ['python'],})\n`\n\nUm código simples onde faço um loop que vai de 0 a 1000000 (estou fazendo 1000001 inserção), e dentro de cada interação do loop estou gerando um registro no banco de dados. Veja abaixo o resultado:\n\n`shell\n(riak-test) ~/Sites/riak-test$ time python riak.py\npython riak.py  15.60s user 0.14s system 99% cpu 15.850 total\n\n(riak-test) ~/Sites/riak-test$ time python mongodb.py\npython mongodb.py  144.14s user 35.47s system 55% cpu 5:25.85 total\n``\n\nRealmente o tempo de execução do Riak é muito mas muito rápido, o que me deixou mais surpreso foi o tempo do MongoDB, o MongoDB demorou 9 vezes mais comparado com o Riak.\n\nNão estou falando que o MongoDB é ruim, ate mesmo que tenho projetos grande em produção usando ele e dependendo do projeto/infra recomendo usar MongoDB.",

Dava para ver no rosto dos argentinos a vontade de aprender e de consumir o maximo de informação possível, na PyCon Argentina de 2012 teve uma ótima seleção de palestra, onde foi abordado temas como asynchrony (twisted), Plone (com Erico Andrei - Brasileiro), web2py  (com Massimo Di Pierro - criador do framework), Python 3.3 (com Brett Cannon - Desenvolvedor Google) e muito mais.\n\nTive grande privilegio de palestra sobre London Framework, foi apresentado o motivo de criar um novo framework (Python) e hoje temos funcionando dentro do London. A repercussão foi muito positiva, recebi muitos tweets e e-mails de desenvolvedores querendo saber mais sobre London Framework, o que mostra grande aceitação e necessidade (semelhantes) do framework dentro da comunidade Argentina. Veja abaixo os slide da palestra de London Framework:\n\n{{< slideshare 2DLd4OvBUeGT2M  >}}\n\nA pedidos da organização, fiz minha palestra em portunhol (tinha planejado apresentá-la em inglês, já que não sou fluente em espanhol). Pelas conversas de corredor, acredito que o público entendeu bem o meu portunhol!\n\n\n\nNo final do primeiro dia de evento tivemos uma confraternização, onde a organização da PyCon Argentina chamou uma pizzaria conhecida de Buenos Aires para fazer algumas pizza. A forma dos argentino preparar a pizza é bem diferente de nos Brasileiros, não querendo puxar sardinha para os Argentinos, é muito gostosa a pizza Argentina.",

Será que isso é realmente verdade?\n\nDepois do que eu escutei o pessoal falando eu não queria nem saber desse cara chamado Plone, ate mesmo que para desenvolver uma solução de gerenciamento de conteúdo usando Django não é muito trabalhoso (Realmente era assim que eu pensava, mal eu sabia que estava completamente enganado). Como eu fiz para mudar esse preconceito que tinha?\n\nRealmente para mim mudar esse pensamento foi preciso senta e conhecer a ferramenta, não foi um trabalho muito facil pois como já relatei vim de Django e para mim era preciso subir um ambiente relativamente parecido, mas é Plone e ele roda encima do servidor de aplicação Zope e isso é algo que eu não conhecia (apenas tinha uma ideia do que era mas o que é realmente não sabia) em fim, depois do esforço de conhecer o Zope e Plone achei bacana. Mas achar bacana e colocar em produção é bem diferente.\n\nNo começo de agosto assumi um cargo de lider tecnico da tv1.com, eis que surge uma demanda gigantesca pois atendemos muitos sites do Governo Brasileiro, tais como:\n\n- Portal Brasil\n- Secom\n- Planalto\n- Biblioteca da Presidencia\n- Emquestão\n- entre outros...\n\nTodos os sites é em Plone, e por esse motivo tive que estudar ainda mais do que estava estudando...\n\nSemana passada Liz Leddy e Nejc Zupan (dois desenvolvedores Plone) estava no Brasil para participar do evento Plone Symposium South America e Caipirinha Sprint (um dos melhores sprint que participei). O sprint foi muito bom fiquei surpreso com a qualidade do código que o Plone tem e como o pessoal leva a escrita de teste unitario e teste funcional a serio, o que posso falar é que 100% do código Plone tem cobertura de teste (se você que ver com os seus proprio olhos aqui explica como rodar os teste com coverage).\n\nBom o que posso falar mais é que agora sou um core commiter do Plone:\n\n\n\nBom nós desenvolvedores (Python) temos mania de criticar (ter preconceito) ou não ter uma iniciativa para estudar uma nova tecnologia, o que posso falar para essas pessoas (eu realmente sou um desse) é: Conheça para depois tomar suas propria decisão, se você acha que um projeto pode ser mais simples ou melhor em um ponto especifico, não esqueça que você desenvolvedor (Python) tem capacidade de ajudar um projeto open source.",

    "content" : "Muitas pessoas usam Squid para fazer qual quer tipo de proxy, ate mesmo para proxy transparente para usar em servidor web, por exemplo:\n\nVocê tem um site que precisa ter IP aqui no Brasil so que como o custo de servidor e link aqui no Brasil é muito caro, você pode fazer um proxy transparente para o servidor aqui no Brasil ser um cara que vai receber a requisição e repassar para o outro servidor que esteja em qual quer lugar do mundo. Com essa solução podemos ter uma maquina simples (maquina com pouco poder de processamento) pois ela só vai receber o trafego e repassar para o servidor que esteja em outro local.\n\nVamos imaginar um exemplo pratico, preciso que o usuário acesse o IP 177.71.248.185 (é um servidor da Amazon no Brasil), esse servidor precisa receber a requisição e repassar para o IP 67.159.35.2 (é maquina principal onde é processado o backend, esse servidor esta fora do Brasi). Foi usado essa solução em um portal que atendo para ter baixa latencia.\n\nVamos ao exemplo pratico:\n\n``nginx\nupstream server {\n    server 67.159.35.2;\n}\nserver {\n    listen       80;\n    server_name  avelino.us www.avelino.us;\n    location / {\n        proxy_cache proxy-cache;\n        proxy_cache_key $host$request_uri$args;\n        proxy_ignore_headers Cache-Control Expires;\n        proxy_cache_min_uses 1;\n        proxy_hide_header Set-Cookie;\n        proxy_cache_valid 200 301 302 30m;\n        proxy_cache_valid any 0m;\n        proxy_buffering on;\n\n        proxy_pass http://server;\n        proxy_redirect off;\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n    }\n\n}\n``\n\nCriei um upstream server para falar qual é o servidor de destino do trafego, na configuração acima tem um cache de 30 minutos pois no servidor principal tem cache de 4 horas.\n\nLogicamente que existe desvantagem com isso, pois vamos estar trafegando em duas (ou mais) redes, assim usando o trafego do servidor que esta recebendo a primeira requisição e do segunda que esta recebendo um requisição do primeiro.",

    "content" : "Existe muitas pessoas querendo estudar Node.js pela simplicidade de trabalhar com processamento assíncrono e por usar JavaScript em server side. JavaScript é uma linguagem simples mas para desenvolvimento Client side mas ao mesmo tempo quando colocamos JavaScript do lado do servidor começa a surgi algumas duvidas como: estrutura do software, como criar biblioteca, qual Framework usar e muitas outras.\n\nDando uma olhada no Github vi que tem muitos software que parece uma lingüiça com mais de 500 linhas em um mesmo arquivo, aí me vem a seguinte pergunta JavaScript não é orientado a objeto? logicamente que sim, então tem alguma coisa errada pois uns dos paradigma é dividir funcionabilidade onde cada modulo faça sua parte e usando todas faz o que foi proposto a ser feito.\n\nEntão vamos lá, seguindo um exemplo simples:\n\n Conectar em um banco de dados\n Fazer insert, update e delete\n Desconectar do banco de dados\n\nO exemplo usado encontra-se no repositorio example-nodejs-mongodb (desculpe, acabei apagando o repositorio no passado :/*) na minha conta do Github, nesse exemplo vou usar o banco de dados MongoDB por ser mais simples de instalar e usar (Pois é um banco de dados NoSQL) . Dado que já esteja instalado o MongoDB em seu sistema operacional (Para usuarios Linux basta baixar o source do MongoDB no site e depois rodar o binario mongod, já para usuarios Windows não tenho não tenho experiencia no ambiente mas achei esse tutorial que pode ajudar). A instalação do NodeJS e NPM no Linux e Windows é uma operação relativamente simples, por isso não vou detalhar todo o processo, você pode ver nos artigos nesse blogpost.\n\nA primeira coisa que temos que ter em mente é que tudo o que é escrito dentro de um package (proprio) não é levado para fora, você precisa especificar o que realmente quer expor do seu package. No arquivo mongocon.js temos um exemplo de como trabalhar com exports no Node.JS:\n\n``js\nvar mongoose = require('mongoose');\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/avelinous');\n\nexports.mongoose = mongoose;\n`\n\nNo exemplo acima estou expondo toda a classe do mongoose, eu poderia restringir export só alguns metodos por exemplo:\n\n`js\nvar mongoose = require('mongoose');\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/avelinous');\n\nexports.mongoose_schema = mongoose.Schema;\n`\n\nAssim podemos limitar o acesso dentro de um package.\n\nCaso queira fazer um package e expor publicamente via NPM, basta criar um package.json juntamente com o seu source, assim pode colocar dependencias que o seu package tem e em qual versão do NodeJS ele roda, veja o exemplo de um package.json:\n\n`json\n{\n    name: mongo_test,\n    description: A package using mongoose ODM,\n    author: Avelino <t AT avelino DOT run>,\n    dependencies: {\n        mongoose: >= 2.7.0\n    },\n    engine: node 0.6.19\n}\n``\n\nPronto, com isso é facil enviar o seu package para o repositorio do NPM.",

O lado bom é que tem a interação do time com o novo desenvolvedor, mais isso acaba ficando chato pois se o novo desenvolvedor não esta entendo ele vai ficar com vergonha (ou alguma coisa do genero) de se expressa falando que não esta entendo alguma parte do fluxo do projeto ou mesmo código.\n\nPoderia falar mais 1001 experiência que tive essa semana, mas vou ir gerando blog post com os passar das semanas, assim posso ir aprofundando cada dia mais da experiência vivida.\n\n> Realmente vale apena trabalhar para uma empresa de fora do Brasil.",

O vim nasceu como um clone para Amiga do editor vi criado por Bill Joy em 1976, adicionando algumas funcionalidades extras, daí seu nome (VI iMproved ou VI Melhorado). Este editor se adaptou rapidamente a outras plataformas.\n\nAssumindo que o vi já esta instalado no meu micro, vamos instalar as configurações que eu fiz, basta rodar os seguintes comando no seu bash (Linux ou Mac):\n\n``shell\ncurl https://raw.github.com/avelino/.vimrc/master/bootstrap.sh -o - | sh\n`\n\n> instalação depreciada, o projeto evoluiu para Vim-Bootrap\n\nApós isso ele vai baixar o repositório na sua pasta HOME.\nRecomendo o uso o VIM em GUI pois podemos chegar 256 cores, ou seja, colocar temas mais agradável e assim deixando o uso do vim mais confortável para o desenvolvimento, para Linux é o gvim e para mac o macvim (Para mac o Björn Winckler fez um ótimo trabalho, na minha humilde opinião é a melhor versão do VIM via GUI).\n\nChega de blablabla né, vamos logo para o que realmente interessa, como o VIM ficou e como utilizar ele?\n\n\n\nUsando o vim para navegar nas pasta de um projeto:\n\n\n\nBuscando arquivo por nome dentro do projeto:\n\n\n\nListar todas as class e def do arquivo esta esta aberto (Python)\n\n\n\nLista de comandos para usar no 'vim', lembrando que esses comando foi customizado:\n\n- :cd /path Abrir pasta\n- tn Abrir nova aba\n- te Abrir nova aba e carregar arquivo\n- t] Proxima aba\n- t[ Voltar aba\n- Ctrl+c Adicionar todos os arquivos no cache para poder fazer busca de arquivo (recomendo fazer isso ao abrir o projeto)\n- Ctrl+f Busca arquivo e abre na mesma aba\n- Ctrl+s Busca arquivo e abre em uma nova aba\n- \\b Abre arquivo que esta no buffer do vim (Arquivo abertos)\n- \\d,, \\n ou F3 Abre navegador de arquivo\n- \\f Lista todas as class e def (Python)\n- \\j Vai para declaração de um metodo\n- \\r Renomear todos os metodos\n- [e Move linha para cima\n- e] Move linha para baixo\n- \\v ou Ctrl+w + v Divide a tela em vertical\n- \\h ou Ctrl+w + s Divide a tela em horizontal\n- \\w ou Ctrl+w + q Fecha a aba atual\n- Ctrl+k Abre console Python\n- Ctrl+j Roda o script Python aberto\n- \\sh Abre bash (shell)\n- \\p Manda o arquivo em aberto para o dpaste.com\n- \\ga Git add .\n- \\gc Git commit\n- \\gsh Git push\n- \\gs Git status\n- \\gd Git diff\n- \\gr Git remove\n- \\S Remove todos os espaços do final\n- \\c` Lista controle de versao do buffer",

    "content" : "Essa semana que passou tive uma necessidade para um sistema de trabalhar com UPLOAD de arquivos, ate ai é simples, só que o sistema estava em Google App Engine, depois de apanhar um pouco resolvi fazer um post aqui no Blog para deixar documentado como não é complicado trabalhar com BlobProperty no BigTable.\n\nPrimeiro vamos criar um Modal onde vai ter dois campo o arquivo e o mimetype dele:\n\n``python\nclass DatastoreFile(db.Model):\n    data = db.BlobProperty(required=True)\n    mimetype = db.StringProperty(required=True)\n`\n\nAgora vamos criar a views onde ele vai processar o formulario e o POST do formulario:\n\n`python\nclass MainHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):\n    def get(self):\n        self.response.out.write(template.render(upload.html, {}))\n\n    def post(self):\n        file = self.request.POST['file']\n\n        entity = DatastoreFile(data=file.value, mimetype=file.type)\n        entity.put()\n\n        file_url = http://%s/%d/%s % (self.request.host, entity.key().id(), file.name)\n        self.response.out.write(Your uploaded file is now available at %s % (file_url,))\n`\n\nPodemos notar que na definição get() temos apenas a renderização do upload.html, o conteudo dele é bem simples, temos um input do tipo file e outro submit:\n\n`html\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>File Upload</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <form method=post action=/ enctype=multipart/form-data>\n    <input type=file name=file />\n    <input type=submit value=Upload />\n  </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n`\n\nFalando da definição post() que esta na classe MainHandler ela que faz o trabalho de fazer o UPLOAD do arquivo para dentro do BlobProperty, é um processo bem simples, a variável file recebe o POST do input file, depois disso chamamos o modal que tem o nome de DatastoreFile passando dois parâmetros que é os dois campos criados, o data e mimetype, depois disso é só fazer o put() que seja salvo no banco de dados. Dentro do post() eu gero o link para download do arquivo na variável file_url, onde passo o HOST (url do sistema), id() (do arquivo que foi feito upload) e file name (Nome do campo que recebeu o arquivo).\n\nAgora temos que fazer a classe para download do arquivo onde vamos mudar o Content-Type do response para o mime-type do arquivo que foi feito o upload, exemplo: fiz o upload de um arquivo no formato JPG o mime type dele é image/jpeg, então tenho que fazer o responser renderizar em formatado image/jpeg.\n\nNa URL que montamos para download passamos a seguinte informação id e file name onde temos que criar uma definição get() que receba essas informações:\n\n`python\nclass DownloadHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):\n    def get(self, id, filename):\n        entity = DatastoreFile.get_by_id(int(id))\n        self.response.headers['Content-Type'] = entity.mimetype\n        self.response.out.write(entity.data)\n`\n\nRecebendo as duas variáveis podemos fazer um consulta no BigTable de forma simples onde busco o id, pego o retorno do banco de dados e coloco que o response.headers['Content-Type'] é o mime-type que esta salvo no banco e depois é só escrever o arquivo na tela.\n\nAgora vamos criar as rotas da URL:\n\n`python\ndef main():\n    application = webapp.WSGIApplication([\n        ('/', MainHandler),\n        ('/(\\d+)/(.*)', DownloadHandler)\n        ],debug=True)\n    util.run_wsgi_app(application)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n``\n\nQuem ainda estiver com duvida pode dar uma olhar no repositorio:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/avelino/post_py_upload_de_arquivo_no_gae/src",

    "content" : "Certificados Digitais EV SSL, ou em português SSL de Validação Avançada, são certificados qualificados que se apresentam aos usuários da Internet de forma distinta dos demais certificados, garantindo assim aos usuários que o site acessado possui um certificado SSL emitido segundo um processo altamente seguro e verificado através de uma auditoria.\n\nHistória\n\nO Comércio via Internet está enfrentando uma crise de segurança. A confiança na segurança de sites está diminuindo, e o número de consumidores que estão deixando de fazer transações on-line está aumentando. Segundo o instituto Forrester Research, ao final de 2005, 24% dos usuários de Internet não compraria via web para os feriados de final de ano pois não se sentiam seguros e 61% reportou que haviam reduzido as compras online por algum motivo.\n\nAgora em 2007 empresas com operações online poderão mostrar definitivamente sua identidade para os seus clientes – e os clientes poderão confirmar esta identidade antes de confiar no site. Essa oportunidade se deve ao resultado da grande evolução no backbone de segurança WEB nos últimos 10 anos. É a introdução de um novo tipo de certificado SSL, o primeiro desde a origem desta tecnologia há mais de uma década atrás.\n\nEstes novos certificados são chamados Certificados Extended Validation SSL e eles representam mais de um ano de esforços feitos pelo CA/Browser Fórum, um consórcio de empresas líderes em manutenção de Browser e Autoridades Certificadoras de SSL. Os Certificados EV SSL irão facilitar o comércio online em todas as suas formas, aumentando a confiança dos usuários, legitimando sites e reduzindo significativamente a eficácia dos ataques de fraude e roubo de senha.\n\n\nEV SSL no Brasil\n\nNo Brasil o certificado está sendo comercializado pela Certisign, Unicert, Comodo e Secsign. Até o final do ano estima-se que do total de vendas de certificados para servidores, 20% sejam no modelo EV SSL. Segundo a projeção da Certisign, isso significa a venda de quase 4.500 certificados.\n\nEspera-se que no prazo de dois anos todas as empresas que se prestam a realizar transações on-line (como sites de e-commerce, bancos, etc...) adotem este produto, pois ele garante identificação visual, maior segurança e conforto para o consumidor.",

    "content" : "O foco este post é levar você aprender computação com Python.\n\nPara calcular as raízes em função do segundo grau, utilizamos uma fórmula muito querida por todos que estudam no ensino médio, a famosa fórmula de Bhaskara:\n\n\n\nOnde cada letra desta fórmula representa os coeficientes da função do segundo grau que queremos resolver. Basta substituir e achar os valores. Podem notar que há um ± no meio da fórmula. Pois é, é daí que irá sair dois resultados: um com o sinal de + e outro com o sinal de -. Veja o exemplo:\n\n\n\nNeste exemplo temos os coeficientes, a=2, b= -6 e c= -20 (Muita atenção para os sinais)\nAgora substituindo na fórmula de Bhaskara:\n\n\n\nAgora chegamos no momento crucial do cáculo das raízes.\nDevemos separar esta conta em duas: uma com o sinal de + e a outra com o sinal de -. Assim:\n\n\n\nPortanto as duas raízes da função são 5 e -2.\n\nChega de blablabla e vamos ver como isso fica em Python:\n\n``python\nimport sys, math\n\na=input (a:)\nb=input (b:)\nc=input (c:)\nd=(b^2)-(4ac) Mário Meyer\nd=((b^2)-4a)c Esta errado esta linha, usar a linha superior.\nif d<0 :\n        print (Delta negativo, raiz impossivel de ser extraida.)\n        sys.exit()\n\nelse : print Delta: %s. % d\n        m1=math.sqrt(d)\n        x1=(-b+m1)/(2a)\n        x2=(-b-m1)/(2a)\n        print Raiz ~ X1= %s. % x1\n        print Raiz ~ X2= %s. % x2\n``",
