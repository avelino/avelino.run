  "content" : "Have you ever stopped to think about how the people around you influence your life?\nOften, we get used to certain companions without realizing that they might be harming us. In this post, we'll explore the importance of carefully selecting the people we surround ourselves with and how this can positively impact our well-being.\n\nWhy select your company?\n\nLiving with toxic, negative people or those who don't share our values can generate stress, anxiety and even low self-esteem. These relationships can drain our energy, prevent us from achieving our goals and compromise our happiness.\n\nOn the other hand, surrounding ourselves with positive people, who support and inspire us, can boost our personal and professional growth, increase our self-confidence and provide us with a lighter and happier life.\n\nHow to identify people who don't do you good?\n\n Pay attention to how you feel: After interacting with certain people, do you feel more energized or more exhausted? More motivated or more demotivated? If the answer is negative, maybe it's time to rethink that relationship.\n Observe patterns of behavior: Toxic people often exhibit behaviors such as constant negativity, excessive criticism, lack of empathy and disrespect for boundaries.\n Trust your intuition: Sometimes, we feel that something is wrong in a relationship, even without knowing how to explain why. Trust your instincts and don't ignore these signs.\n\nHow to distance yourself from toxic people?\n\n Set clear boundaries: Communicate your needs and boundaries assertively and don't allow them to be disrespected.\n Learn to say no: Don't feel obligated to accept invitations or requests that make you feel uncomfortable.\n Seek support: Talk to friends, family or a professional about your difficulties and ask for help to deal with these situations.\n Prioritize your well-being: Remember that you have the right to distance yourself from people who harm you.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that some relationships may never be more than circles of laughter.\n\nWhile deep, meaningful connections are essential, it's also healthy to have friends with whom you can simply relax, have fun, and share lighthearted moments. These relationships can be a source of joy and stress relief, even if they don't necessarily involve deep emotional intimacy.\n\nImportant references\n\nTo deepen your view of healthy interpersonal relationships, I recommend reading the books:\n\n How to Win Friends & Influence People by Dale Carnegie: A classic guide to building positive and meaningful relationships.\n Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman*: Will help you better understand your emotions and those of other people, making it easier to recognize harmful relationships.\n\nConclusion:\n\nSelecting the people around us is an act of self-love and care for our mental and emotional health. By prioritizing our well-being and distancing ourselves from toxic people, we open space for healthier, happier and more meaningful relationships.\n\n> remember: you deserve to be surrounded by people who do you good!",
