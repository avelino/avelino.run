  "content" : "A CTO's daily life has no pattern. On a typical Monday I write a board document, run 1:1s with direct reports, discuss strategy with other C-levels, analyze production crashes, help a data scientist think through an algorithm, and still try to keep processes running. All in the same day. Sometimes in the same hour.\n\nIf you expect this post to teach you how to organize all of that, close the tab. It won't happen. Chaos is a feature, not a bug.\n\nThe problem was never lack of information\n\nThe information exists. It's in Slack, Sentry, GitHub, the calendar, Honeycomb metrics, Todoist tickets. The problem is it's scattered across 15 different tools and nobody synthesizes it for you.\n\nThe time between something happened and I know it happened is what separates a CTO who reacts from a CTO who fights fires. And most of the time, that gap is too wide — not because you're incompetent, but because it's humanly impossible to track everything in real time.\n\nI tried everything. Dashboards, check-in routines, Slack alert channels. It partially worked, but the filter was still me. And my filter has limits.\n\nSince December 2025 I've had a copilot\n\nAt the end of 2025, I started using AI agents integrated into my workflow. I'm not talking about ChatGPT open in a browser tab. I'm talking about a system that connects to the tools I already use and works as an intelligence layer between me and the chaos.\n\nIn practice, I configured agents that:\n\n- Monitor production incidents every minute. When something is truly P1 — site down, critical flow broken — I get a notification with context: what's happening, how many users are affected, which squad owns it, and a concrete suggestion for the first step. It's not a generic 500 errors increasing alert. It's the purchase flow is 100% broken, 431 events in the last hour, squad X owns this, suggest escalating to infra.\n\n- Compile a morning briefing before my first meeting. Sentry errors compared to the previous day, SLOs burning budget, relevant Slack threads, PRs waiting for review, pending tasks. All translated from technical language to business impact. It's not LockError in Redis with 7,605 events. It's processing queue stalling, potentially impacting customer transactions.\n\n- Sync my personal calendars with the corporate one automatically, creating busy blocks. Seems trivial, but it was something I did manually and frequently forgot.\n\n- Filter GitHub and Slack notifications by relevance. Out of 50 threads per day, I see 5. The ones that need my decision or direct input. The rest is information I absorb in the morning briefing.\n\nWhat this is not\n\nIt's not magic. It doesn't replace strategic thinking. It doesn't make decisions for me.\n\nThe agent doesn't know that architecture decision X will impact the Q3 roadmap. Doesn't know that employee Y is demotivated and needs a conversation. Doesn't know that the board wants to see metric Z in the next presentation.\n\nWhat it does is eliminate the collection work. Those two hours a day I spent navigating between Slack, Sentry, GitHub, and the calendar to build a mental map of what's happening — gone. Information arrives synthesized, prioritized, and with context.\n\nAnd that frees up something priceless: time to think. A CTO who only reacts doesn't lead. But to stop reacting, you first need to know what's happening without spending half your day finding out.\n\nThree months later\n\nI've been using this setup every day since December. What actually changed:\n\nReaction time dropped dramatically. P1 incidents I used to discover 15-20 minutes later (when someone mentioned me on Slack) now arrive in under 2 minutes with full context.\n\nDecision quality improved. Not because I got smarter. Because context arrives faster and more complete. Deciding with information is different from deciding with intuition.\n\nFewer alignment meetings. Half the meetings I used to have were to collect information that now arrives automatically. I canceled several and nobody missed them.\n\nMore time for work that matters. Strategic documents, quality 1:1s, thinking about hiring, reviewing architecture. The CTO work that actually moves the needle.\n\nThe chaos won't go away — but your response can be better\n\nIf you're a CTO or tech leader, you know: chaos is inevitable. Software breaks, people leave, priorities shift, the market surprises. No tool will turn your day into a neatly organized calendar of color-coded blocks.\n\nIn 1986, Andrew Grove wrote in High Output Management that a manager's work is measured by the output of the teams under their influence — not by the number of meetings they attend or emails they answer. Grove argued that managerial leverage comes from activities that multiply the results of many people at once. The problem is that, in practice, most CTOs spend their day collecting information instead of acting on it.\n\nAI is not a threat to the CTO role. It's leverage in the sense Grove described. Every minute you don't spend navigating between tools to understand what's happening is a minute you can invest in decisions that move the company. Context arrives faster, more complete, and you act before — not after.\n\nWe don't need to run from AI. We need to stop treating it as a tech curiosity and start using it for what it really is: an extension of our ability to process chaos.\n\nThe right question isn't how do I organize everything?. It's how fast do I get to the problem?.\n\nAnd if today's answer is depends on when someone pings me on Slack — maybe it's time to rethink who (or what) is doing that filtering for you.",
