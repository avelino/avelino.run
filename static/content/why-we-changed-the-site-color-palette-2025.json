  "content" : "If youâ€™ve visited avelino.run recently, you may have noticed: the visual vibe is softer, calmer â€” and thatâ€™s completely intentional.\n\nWe redesigned the siteâ€™s color palette with one goal in mind: to make your reading experience more comfortable. And yes, thereâ€™s science behind it.\n\n\n\nðŸ§  The Psychology of Color and Visual Fatigue\n\nStudies in interface design and cognitive neuroscience show that pure white backgrounds and high-contrast elements can cause eye strain during extended reading sessions. A study published in the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies points out that soft, lightly tinted backgrounds can reduce visual stress and help readers stay focused for longer.\n\nSo we replaced the pure white background with #FAF3FA, a soft lavender tone that keeps the clarity of white while being easier on the eyes.\n\nðŸŽ¨ The New Color Palette\n\nOur focus was to create a harmonious, accessible experience with a modern and welcoming vibe. Here's the palette:\n\n- Background: #FAF3FA â€“ soft lavender that diffuses light and reduces glare.\n- Main Text: #4A4A4A â€“ dark gray for clean, high-contrast readability without harshness.\n- Links and Highlights: #E6E6FA â€“ a soft lavender accent that complements the background.\n- Buttons/CTAs: #BA55D3 â€“ a vibrant purple for elements that need to stand out.\n- Borders/Dividers: #E0E0E0 â€“ light gray to organize content gently and subtly.\n\nðŸ’¡ Our Goal Is Simple\n\nWe want reading on this site to feel as effortless as a good conversation. No fatigue. No distraction. Just clarity, flow, and focus.\n\n---\n\nReference:\nBauerly, M., & Liu, Y. (2006).
