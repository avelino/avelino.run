The discomfort generated by each transformation is not an enemy, but a stimulus that I use to improve my environment and who I am on the inside.\nIf a change doesn\u0027t produce the expected results, instead of giving in to discouragement, I return to where I started. I treat each failure as a learning opportunity, a challenge to improve my understanding and adapt my next agenda for change.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFull article by \u003Ca href=\u0022https://avelino.run/users/hey\\\u0022 class=\u0022u-url mention\u0022\u003E@\u003Cspan\u003Ehey\\\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/a\u003E: \u003Ca href=\u0027https://avelino.run/challenge-comfort-and-growth-the-art-of-being-addicted-to-change/\u0027\u003Ehttps://avelino.run/challenge-comfort-and-growth-the-art-of-being-addicted-to-change/\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",
