Companies treat reorganization like a five-alarm fire. It's bizarre. The engine starts vibrating, the chassis rattles, and everyone insists "it'll pass." It won't. **Good teams don't break because you adjust them — they break because you don't.**

The truth is far less dramatic and far more operational: reorganizing is maintenance. It's the 10,000 km service. It's the fine-tuning that separates a team that moves from a team that accelerates.

And, in the end, the equation is almost always the same:

**Trade quantity for talent density.**
The only math that works for product companies.

This isn't motivational fluff. It's empirically solid. Geoff Smart and Randy Street, in the classic *[Who](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345504194)*, go straight to the point: great hiring is the only structural advantage that doesn't decay. Bad hiring, on the other hand, compounds negatively. One A-player lifts the entire team. Three B-players just occupy seats and generate drag. The math never balances.

Ben Horowitz, in *[The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062273205)*, describes the natural rhythm of growing companies: people join, people leave, responsibilities shift, structures evolve. This isn't a leadership failure — it's what happens when you're trying to build something that matters. Static teams are great… for static companies. In the real world, **high performance is flow, not stillness**.

Reed Hastings doubles down in *[No Rules Rules](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1984877860)*: talent density is the primary accelerant of organizational performance. Not processes. Not rituals. Not frameworks. **Exceptional people in critical roles.** People who solve, simplify, deliver. People who raise the bar without asking permission.

And this brings us to the most uncomfortable part — the one managers avoid but leaders confront: **roles that outlive their usefulness.**

In my own case, years ago we created a "Principal Engineer" role. It served a purpose: it helped a former team member grow. It made sense at the time. But contexts evolve, people move on, and teams transform. And like in many companies, the title stayed behind — a relic from a past that no longer exists.

To be blunt, I never stopped to question whether the role still made sense.
When I finally did, the answer was obvious. It didn't.

Will Larson explains this clearly in *[The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1484271901)*: Staff and Principal roles exist to solve actual organizational problems, not to decorate résumés. When a title becomes ornamental, it stops aligning and starts confusing. It creates boundaries where there should be collaboration. It creates fuzzy expectations where there should be clear ownership.

So I removed it. No drama. No poetry. No "transition process."
**A title that doesn't accelerate becomes an obstacle. And obstacles get removed.**

This is what many leaders miss: reorganizing isn't a commentary on the past — it's a commitment to the future.
It isn't a judgment of those who left — it's clarity for those who stay.
It isn't a plot twist — it's routine maintenance.

If you lead a team and fear changing the structure, the issue isn't the change. It's the anesthesia.
Mature teams don't fear movement. They fear silence. They fear ambiguity.
When you communicate with blunt honesty, explain the why, and show the path, the team exhales.
And when you add truly exceptional talent, the team grows. Always.

That's the maintenance great companies do.
No makeup. No noise. No melodrama.
Just responsibility for what matters: **building with ambition, alongside people who want to play to win.**
