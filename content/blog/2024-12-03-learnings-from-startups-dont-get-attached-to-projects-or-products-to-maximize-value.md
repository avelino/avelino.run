![Learnings from startups: don't get attached to projects or products to maximize value](/blog/learnings-from-startups-dont-get-attached-to-projects-or-products-to-maximize-value.png)

In the fast-paced world of startups and agile companies, one of the most valuable learnings is: don't get attached to a project or product. This advice is crucial to ensure that teams remain focused on delivering value to the business, rather than clinging to solutions that no longer add value.

## Why not get attached?

In a startup, the ability to adapt is essential. If a product is not generating the expected user engagement, persisting in its development can result in maintenance costs without return. As Eric Ries discusses in "The Lean Startup," it is vital that companies are able to pivot quickly, redirecting efforts to initiatives that truly meet market needs and contribute to the company's strategic goals.

### The agile perspective

The agile philosophy, as described by Jeff Sutherland in "Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time," encourages teams to iterate quickly and learn from each development cycle. This means that even if a project was started with enthusiasm, it must be constantly reassessed to ensure it still makes sense in the current context and is aligned with delivering business value.

### Personal and professional growth

Letting go of a project not only benefits the organization but also offers significant opportunities for personal and professional growth. Each project is a chance to learn, evolve technically, and enhance interpersonal skills. Martin Fowler, in "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code," emphasizes the importance of reflecting on the work done to identify areas for improvement and create more efficient and reusable solutions.

### Reflection and continuous learning

Upon completing a project, it is crucial to reflect on what has been done. Questions like "Why did we prioritize this?" and "Why is this task a priority?" should be asked regularly. This practice not only improves the quality of work but also ensures that daily activities are aligned with the company's strategic objectives. This is fundamental to ensuring that the focus remains on delivering value.

## Conclusion

The role of a developer in a startup goes beyond just writing code. It's about deeply understanding business objectives and adapting actions to better meet them. Letting go of projects is not about discarding hard work, but rather about prioritizing what truly matters and being open to new opportunities for learning and growth.

By applying these principles, we can significantly contribute to organizational success while evolving as complete professionals, capable of facing the challenges of an agile and constantly changing work environment.
