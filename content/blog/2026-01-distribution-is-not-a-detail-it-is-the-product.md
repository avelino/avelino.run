Most products are built as if the problem were a lack of features. More screens, more options, more control. But what kills products is rarely that. What kills them is distance. The product is not where the user lives.

A product is not just what you build. A product is what shows up. If the user has to remember that you exist, decide to open something, or step out of their natural daily flow to use you, you're already at a disadvantage. Good products don't ask for attention. They appear at the right moment, in the right place, without requiring conscious effort.

Habit always beats intention. People don't want more things to manage. They want fewer decisions throughout the day. Anything that depends on deliberate effort, constant motivation, or a "I'll check it later" mindset tends to die. Products that survive anchor themselves in what already happens, not in what should happen.

There is an obsession with adding. More functionality, more screens, more possibilities. But for more than a decade now, it has been clear that simplicity is not an aesthetic choice, it is a strategy. Products that last do fewer things, in fewer places, with more clarity. Complexity is rarely a sign of ambition. Most of the time, it is a lack of decision.

Distribution is that decision. Where the product lives defines its frequency, its format, its language, and its limits. When this choice is wrong, everything that comes after becomes compensation. Onboarding to explain too much. Notifications to remind. Features to justify existence. None of that fixes the core problem.

Truly good products don't need to be remembered. They are present. They don't compete with the user's daily life, they fit into it. The closer a product is to someone's routine, the less surface area it needs. Fewer screens, fewer choices, less explanation. Recurrence replaces complexity.

That's why the right question was never "what else can we build?". The right question is "where does this product already fit without getting in the way?". That answer comes before the first line of code. And it should kill most ideas before they ever turn into a backlog.

Distribution is not the path to the product. It is not what comes after. It is the central decision. If the product does not live where the user already is every day, it simply does not exist.
