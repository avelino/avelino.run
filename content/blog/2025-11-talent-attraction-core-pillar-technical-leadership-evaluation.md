One thing I've learned over the years is that technical leadership is evaluated on far more than just delivery, architecture decisions, or code quality.

There are a few core pillars that define whether a technical leader is actually leading — and **talent attraction is one of the most important pillars in that evaluation**.

If I'm not intentionally bringing great people closer, building relationships, and strengthening the talent ecosystem around my team, then I'm not fulfilling the role.

A leader who can't attract talent eventually limits the team, the culture, the roadmap, and the future.

## Why Talent Attraction Matters in Leadership Evaluation

Talent attraction isn't a "nice-to-have" or a bonus activity.

It's an explicit criterion in how technical leadership should be assessed because:

- teams depend on who we bring in,
- culture depends on who we surround ourselves with,
- innovation depends on diversity of thought,
- long-term velocity depends on having the right people, not just the right process.

When I'm evaluated as a leader, people don't look apenas at *what* I deliver.

They look at *who* I attract, how I represent the team externally, and whether I'm actively creating a strong pipeline for the future.

## The Questions I Use to Evaluate Myself

To stay honest with myself — and to avoid the comfort zone — I revisit a few questions regularly. They help me measure whether I'm meeting this leadership pillar or neglecting it.

### 1. Am I actively building relationships with professionals outside my team?

If the answer is no, I have to ask:

**What have I done this month to change that?**

Leadership evaluation expects me to show intentionality here.

Relationships don't just happen — I need to create them.

### 2. How much time am I investing in staying connected to talent?

If I claim I value this pillar but invest zero time in it, the inconsistency is obvious.

Networking, community presence, open-source engagement, writing, participating in discussions — all of this counts.

And if I'm not doing any of it, I'm failing a core dimension of technical leadership evaluation.

### 3. Does my team have a clear value proposition for potential candidates?

When someone considers joining my team, what story do I tell?

Impact, culture, learning, autonomy, mission — if I can't articulate this clearly and consistently, it affects how I'm evaluated as a leader.

A leader who can't communicate the value of the team won't attract the right people.

## Networking Is Not "Extra Work." It Is Leadership Work

For some time, I treated networking as something I'd do "when I had time."

That was a mistake.

Leadership evaluation doesn't separate "core duties" from "relationship building."

Both are core duties.

When I started treating networking, visibility, and relationship-building as part of my job — not an optional activity — everything changed:

- hiring became easier,
- performance increased,
- the team became more diverse in thinking,
- the culture grew stronger,
- and the organization saw me as a more complete leader.

This is why talent attraction is such a central evaluation pillar:

it influences every other pillar indirectly.

## How I Practice This Consistently

I moved away from big, sporadic recruitment efforts and instead built small habits:

- I reserve 1 hour a week to talk to interesting people;
- I stay engaged with tech communities;
- I write publicly about what we're building;
- I keep in touch with strong candidates, even when there's no open role;
- I make the team's challenges and achievements visible.

This consistency shows up clearly when leadership evaluates my impact.

## A Book That Reinforced My Thinking

**[Remarkable Tech Talent: A Technical Leader's Guide to Recruiting the Best People in Your Industry* — **Paul Turner**](<https://www.amazon.com/dp/1781335095>)**

Two quotes that stuck with me and shaped how I view this leadership pillar:

> "Technical leaders who want to secure the best workforce know that talent is rare, time is valuable, and competition is intense."
> "If you want the best possible technical business, you need the best possible technical people."

These lines made me realize that attracting talent isn't luck — it's leadership behavior.

And it is absolutely something for which leaders should be evaluated.

## Conclusion

Talent attraction is not a secondary activity.

It is one of the **core pillars used to evaluate technical leadership** — right alongside technical depth, execution quality, architectural thinking, and strategic clarity.

If I'm not investing consciously, consistently, and personally in bringing great people closer, I'm not delivering on the full responsibility of being a technical leader.

Building a strong team starts with me.

And it begins with showing up, connecting, learning, and staying close to exceptional people.
