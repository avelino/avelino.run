Yesterday was awesome! A day to bring together the technology team of [Buser Brasil](https://buser.com.br).

An important day to reinforce what really matters: the unity of the team. We paused to look back, revisit what went right and, most importantly, what didn’t. Not to point fingers, but to ensure that these same mistakes won’t be repeated in 2025. Reflection without witch hunts, filled with a lot of learning.

If there’s one thing that became clear this year, it’s that no one here is in the same place they started. Every mistake, every challenge, every victory… everything served for us to evolve as a team and as professionals. I am sure that in 2025 we will enter more experienced, more aligned, and with much more confidence in what we are capable of doing together - playing as a team.

**I’ll be direct:**** a leader without a team is nothing. Having exceptional people by your side to turn ideas into reality is what makes the difference. Leading is about example, not about speeches.

Let’s go all in for 2025!
