I have been pondering about the ideas of two articles:

* [Enthusiasm is Common. Endurance is Rare](https://elevatesociety.com/enthusiasm-is-common-endurance-is/)
* [What is Your “Average Speed” in Your Life, Your Health, and Your Work?](https://jamesclear.com/average-speed)

Both gravitates to the same idea, zero acceleration. The key is to keep a sustainable rhythm.

**BUT** never zero acceleration at zero speed.

Drip by drip. Keep showing up, every day. One is better than zero.
