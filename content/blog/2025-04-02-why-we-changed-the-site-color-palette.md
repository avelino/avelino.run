If youâ€™ve visited [avelino.run](https://avelino.run) recently, you may have noticed: the visual vibe is softer, calmer â€” and thatâ€™s completely intentional.

We redesigned the siteâ€™s color palette with one goal in mind: **to make your reading experience more comfortable**. And yes, thereâ€™s science behind it.

## ðŸ§  The Psychology of Color and Visual Fatigue

Studies in interface design and cognitive neuroscience show that **pure white backgrounds and high-contrast elements** can cause eye strain during extended reading sessions. A study published in the *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies* points out that soft, lightly tinted backgrounds can reduce visual stress and help readers stay focused for longer.

So we replaced the pure white background with **#FAF3FA**, a soft lavender tone that keeps the clarity of white while being easier on the eyes.

## ðŸŽ¨ The New Color Palette

Our focus was to create a harmonious, accessible experience with a modern and welcoming vibe. Here's the palette:

- **Background:** `#FAF3FA` â€“ soft lavender that diffuses light and reduces glare.
- **Main Text:** `#4A4A4A` â€“ dark gray for clean, high-contrast readability without harshness.
- **Links and Highlights:** `#E6E6FA` â€“ a soft lavender accent that complements the background.
- **Buttons/CTAs:** `#BA55D3` â€“ a vibrant purple for elements that need to stand out.
- **Borders/Dividers:** `#E0E0E0` â€“ light gray to organize content gently and subtly.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Goal Is Simple

We want reading on this site to feel as effortless as a good conversation. No fatigue. No distraction. Just clarity, flow, and focus.
