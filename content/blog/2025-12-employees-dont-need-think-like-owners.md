## They need to think like responsible adults

There's a corporate trend that's been annoying me for years: "think like an owner".

Sounds pretty on a culture slide, but in practice it usually turns into two things:

1. Employees blaming themselves for not "giving enough";
2. Companies using guilt and romanticism to squeeze unpaid extra hours.

Employees don't need to think like owners.
Employees need to think like **responsible adults**.

And the person who frames this way better than any leadership book is Erik H. Erikson, the psychoanalyst who mapped human development into eight stages from infancy to old age in the classic *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*.

What he calls "psychosocial crises" is exactly the kind of conflict that shows up inside companies when we treat adults like teenagers who need a "dad-boss" or like mini-entrepreneurs playing pretend.

Let's break it down.

## What does Erikson actually say about "adult life"?

Erikson lays out eight stages of development, each one with a central tension (a conflict) we need to face: trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs. inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, integrity vs. despair.

When we talk work and career, three of these matter a lot (as presented in *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*):

- **Identity vs. role confusion (adolescence):**
  The core question is: *"Who am I? What role do I play in the world?"*
  When that's unresolved, adults glue their identity to the company: "I am Company X". That's where you get the employee who sacrifices themselves to the point of self-destruction thinking that's maturity. It's not. It's hanging your ego on someone else's balance sheet.

- **Intimacy vs. isolation (young adulthood):**
  The question shifts to: *"Can I connect deeply without losing myself?"*
  At work, that's the ability to build strong bonds with the team, the product, the customer — **without fusion**. I care a lot, but I don't become the company. I connect, but I don't dissolve.

- **Generativity vs. stagnation (midlife):**
  Now comes the most "adult" question of all: *"Does my life actually count for something?"*
  Generativity is the concern with building something beyond yourself: kids, projects, legacy, people you helped grow. At work, it's when you stop playing just the "my job title" game and start caring about the real impact of what you deliver.

When a company says "think like an owner", in practice it's trying to skip over stages of human psychology that Erikson describes in *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*.
He's basically saying: **you don't need to be an owner to behave like an adult**. You need to deal with identity, connection, and generativity in a mature way.

## A responsible adult isn't the one who dies for the company

### It's the one who knows when to stop

"Wearing the company jersey" means knowing when to stop for today, because tomorrow there's more and you need to perform tomorrow too.

That's an adult definition.

In Erikson's logic in *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*, maturity rests on two simple (and often ignored) things:

- **Healthy autonomy:** I know how to take care of my own life.
- **Sustained responsibility:** I can keep delivering over time, not just in random hero bursts.

When a company only celebrates the 2 a.m. hero, it's rewarding **infantilized behavior**: people who need to prove their worth through visible sacrifice instead of consistent results.

A responsible adult does a different kind of math:

- If I pull an all-nighter today, I destroy my thinking tomorrow;
- If that becomes a pattern, quality drops;
- If quality drops, my real value goes down, no matter how "dedicated" I look.

So: **knowing when to stop is part of professional ethics**, not laziness.
It's not lack of commitment — it's commitment to continuity. It's the same generativity Erikson marks as a sign of adult life in *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*: building something that lasts, not burning yourself out in a cycle of heroics and collapse.

## Be selfish about your career

### Generativity starts with you

The phrase is intentionally sharp:
**be selfish about your career.**

But this is adult selfishness, not teenager selfishness.

In *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*, Erikson shows that the identity crisis (who am I, what role do I play) comes before the capacity to give yourself to others in a mature way.
In other words: you only become genuinely useful to others once you stop living to please any random authority figure.

In the work context, that leads to a very direct consequence:

- You're not at the company to "look good for the boss";
- You're there to **grow as a professional** and, through that growth, **deliver more value**.

That flips the game:

- Instead of thinking "how do I impress my boss?",
  you think "what technical and behavioral skills make me more valuable in the market — and how do I use that to generate more results here?".

That's generativity applied to your career:
I develop myself, and that development overflows into impact — on the team, the product, the customer.

Being selfish about your career means:

- studying with intent, not just reacting to whatever lands on your lap;
- hunting for projects that increase your complexity, not just your comfort;
- negotiating a context that allows you to perform long term, not just fight fires.

That's not being "less loyal" to the company.
It's being loyal to what, in Erikson's view in *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*, defines adult life: **the capacity to build, guide, care, and create impact**.

## Are you a cost or an investment?

### The math an adult does without drama

Here's a line that hurts, but clarifies:

> Your yearly financial impact for the company has to be way higher than your total comp. Otherwise you're not an investment — you're just a cost.

When Erikson talks about "industry vs. inferiority" in *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*, he's describing that phase where a person starts to ask: *"Can I actually produce something that works in the real world?"*
Lots of people reach adulthood without really crossing that bridge — and then they run from any objective metric.

In a company, the test is brutally simple:

- If what you produce doesn't pay your own salary (and then some), the math doesn't work;
- The company might hold you for a while because of potential, a bet, or context… but **reality always wins in the end**.

Thinking like a responsible adult means accepting this math, no drama, no soap opera:

- What is the direct or indirect impact of my work on revenue, margin, cost, risk, growth?
- What decisions do I make day-to-day that shift that curve?
- What am I learning this year that will dramatically increase my ability to generate value next year?

Erikson helps again: generativity is about *"making your life count"* — at work, that becomes *"making your payroll time count"*.

If you're a manager, the question scales: is your **team** a cost or an investment?
Your job isn't shielding people from any discomfort.
Your job is helping them walk through these professional development crises:

- give context so they understand the game (identity);
- build strong bonds without fusion (intimacy);
- demand real impact, not just visible effort (industry and generativity).

## Wearing the jersey WITHOUT becoming its hostage

"Wearing the jersey" turned toxic because it was hijacked by lazy management culture:
instead of building context, leadership throws guilt.
Instead of designing systems, it leans on "ownership spirit".

If we rewrite this with Erikson and *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)* on the table, the message changes:

- **I don't want you thinking like an owner.**
  Owners deal with capital risk, control, leverage over decisions, legal exposure — it's a different game.

- I want you thinking like a **responsible adult**, someone who:
  - knows their limits and defends them (clear identity);
  - connects deeply with the team without disappearing inside it (mature intimacy);
  - delivers results that cover their cost and still leave a legacy (generativity, not stagnation).

This is a far more robust view — psychologically and economically — than the theater of the "employee-entrepreneur".

## Reference

For anyone who wants the original source:

> **Erikson, E. H. (1982). *[The Life Cycle Completed](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Cycle-Completed-Extended-Version/dp/0393317722)*. New York: W. W. Norton & Company.**

It's a short, straight-to-the-point book where he revisits the eight stages of human development and unpacks what it really means to mature over a lifetime — including the adult phase, where work, caring for others, and legacy show up with full force.

To wrap it up:
don't push people to "think like owners".
Owners already have their own mess to deal with.

Push people to **think like adults**:
protect their own energy, be intelligently selfish with their careers, and deliver results that make any "cost cutting" conversation sound ridiculous when their name comes up.

That's not fluffy culture talk.
That's developmental psychology wired straight into how work actually functions in the real world.
