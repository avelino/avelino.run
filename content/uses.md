Make sure to check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech) for a list of everyone's **/uses** pages!

I constantly get a few emails (my email is public on my [github profile](https://github.com/avelino)) asking about the software and hardware I use in my day to day life as an open source _product/project_ maintainer.

> My day job is 100% involved with **open source** projects, would you like to support any project I help maintain? see how and who currently supports me [here](/thanks/).
