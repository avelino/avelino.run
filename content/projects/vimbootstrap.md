The **vim-bootstrap** project started with my annoyance of other people using my vim file (my personal vim configuration files), in a conversation with [lerrua](https://github.com/lerrua) I proposed to gather our vim configuration files and make a vim file generator with focus on who is starting to use vim text editor.

The project is actively maintained [by a few people](https://github.com/editor-bootstrap/vim-bootstrap/graphs/contributors), mainly **[Cassio Botaro](https://github.com/cassiobotaro)** - here is my eternal _gratitude_ to *_Cassio_ and the work he has done to sustain the project.
