I’m Thiago Avelino CTO at [buser](https://linkedin.com/company/buserbrasil/) creator/maintainer any [open source projects](https://github.com/avelino)) and Mathematician at [IME-USP - Aplicated Math](https://www.ime.usp.br).

Contributor to any Open Source projects, study focus is **team building**, **people tech management** _(human/evolutionary psychology)_ and **open source** _(and all distributed contribution ecosystem)_. My day job is to help the team I lead to evolve professionally and get to where it planned to get, delivering great results for the company, encouraging them to achieve their best professional performance.

I have talked about open source contribution and today I work more with people management, but I still enjoy programming - even though I have less time to write code - less than I would like. I am usually involved with project that use the technologies:

- Distributed systems
- Lisp dialects (clojure/racket)
- Go
- Python
