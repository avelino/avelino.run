I'm Thiago Avelino, CTO at [Buser](https://linkedin.com/company/buserbrasil/), creator and maintainer of several open source projects, and an Applied Mathematics alumnus from [IME-USP](https://www.ime.usp.br).

I contribute to many open source initiatives. My current focus is on team building, technical leadership, people management (human/evolutionary psychology), and the open source/distributed contribution ecosystem. In my day-to-day work, I help my team grow professionally and deliver outstanding business results.

I often speak about open source contribution. While I now spend more time on people management than coding, I still enjoy programming. I usually work with:

- Distributed systems
- Lisp dialects (Clojure/Racket)
- Go
- Python

Notably, I'm a long-time maintainer of [Awesome Go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go).
